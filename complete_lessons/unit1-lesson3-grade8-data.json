    "content_overview": "\n            This lesson introduces students to Human-Environment Interaction, a foundational concept in geography.\n            Students will explore how Human-Environment Interaction affects our understanding of the world and\n            influences human activities and decision-making. The lesson builds geographic thinking\n            skills through hands-on activities, real-world examples, and collaborative learning.\n            \n            Human-Environment Interaction is essential for students to understand because it provides a framework\n            for analyzing spatial relationships, human-environment interactions, and geographic\n            patterns. This understanding serves as a building block for more advanced geographic\n            concepts throughout the curriculum.\n            ",
