The lesson builds geographic thinking\n            skills through hands-on activities, real-world examples, and collaborative learning.\n            \n            Physical Features is essential for students to understand because it provides a framework\n            for analyzing spatial relationships, human-environment interactions, and geographic\n            patterns. This understanding serves as a building block for more advanced geographic\n            concepts throughout the curriculum.\n            ",
