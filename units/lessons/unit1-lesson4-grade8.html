<h3>Content Overview</h3>
<p>
            This lesson introduces students to Movement and Migration, a foundational concept in geography.
            Students will explore how Movement and Migration affects our understanding of the world and
            influences human activities and decision-making. The lesson builds geographic thinking
            skills through hands-on activities, real-world examples, and collaborative learning.
            
            Movement and Migration is essential for students to understand because it provides a framework
            for analyzing spatial relationships, human-environment interactions, and geographic
            patterns. This understanding serves as a building block for more advanced geographic
            concepts throughout the curriculum.
            </p>

<h3>Opening Hook <span class="time-indicator">5-7 minutes</span></h3>
<p>
            Begin with an engaging question: "What do you think of when you hear the word 'Movement and Migration'?"
            
            Show students 3-4 images that represent different aspects of Movement and Migration. Have them work
            in pairs to discuss what they notice and what questions they have. This activates prior
            knowledge and creates curiosity about the lesson topic.
