Zimbabwe has gold and copper mines as well as productive agriculture and manufacturing. However, high inflation, debts, and war have hurt the economy. 2. Mozambique is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. The economy has been badly damaged by civil war, but it is improving. 3. Comoros is a country made up of four tiny islands. It suffers from a lack of resources and political instability. The government of Comoros is struggling to improve education and promote tourism.YOU TRY IT! Read the following text selections about countries in Southern African. Then, using information from the selections and any prior knowledge that you might have, form a generalization about a country\u2019s economy and its political stability.Form Generalizations READING FOCUS As you read about different people and cultures, yo u probably notice many similarities. Seeing those similarities may help you form a gener alization. A generalization is a statement that applies to many different situations or people, even though it is based on a few specific situations or people. In the foll owing example, a generalization is formed by combining new information with informatio n from personal experience. Sometimes you might also form a generalization by r eading about several new situations, even though you don\u2019t have personal exp erience with the situation. Several large rivers cross Southern Africa\u2019s plains. The Okavango River flows from Angola into a huge basin in Botswana. There, it forms a swampy inland delta that is home to crocodiles, zebras, hippos, and other animals. Many tourists travel to Botswana to see these wild animals in their natural habitat. 3. Generalization: Many people enjoy seeing wild animals in person.1. What you read: Tourists will travel to see wild animals. 2. What you know from personal experience: My family loves to see wild animals in the zoo. As you read this module, use what you already know along with new information to form generalizations about East and Southern Africa. Module 25808Reading Social Studies READING FOCUS Form Generalizations Explain to students that a generalization is a broad, general conclusion drawn from several examples or pieces of evidence. Point out to students that the ability to form generalizations as they read will help them better understand the main points in a text. Share these strategies for how to form generalizations: How to Form Generalizations: To form generalizations, follow these four basic steps: 1. Note details or examples related to a particular topic in the text. Often, an author will provide several examples to make a main point. 2. Make a broad statement based on examples or evidence. Information in the text should lead to a general conclusion about the topic. 3. Check that your generalization is valid. Your statement should allow for exceptions. Some words you can use to show there may be exceptions to your statement are most, some, often, and generally. 4. Avoid forming overgeneralizations, or generalizations that are too broad. Statements like \u201call girls like clothes\u201d and \u201call boys like cars\u201d are overgeneralizations. Overgeneralizations often start with words such as all, everyone, every time, any, anything, no one, or none . YOU TRY IT! Generalization: Political instability usually hurts a country\u2019s economy. 808 Module 25 LESSON 1The Great Rift Valley Mountains and Highlands of East and Southern Africa Namib Desert Game: Where Am I?

Possible answers: rift valleys, Great Rift Valley, Mount Kilimanjaro, Ethiopian Highlands, Drakensberg mountains, Inyanga Mountains, plains, Serengeti Plain, plateaus, Namib Desert, Kalahari Desert, pans, Okavango Basin. Lesson 1 Physical Geography The Big Idea Rift valleys, plateaus, grassy plains, and diverse climate and vegetation types shape life in East and Southern Africa. Main Ideas \u25a0East and Southern Africa\u2019s physical features range from rift valleys to sweeping plateaus. \u25a0Location and elevation shape East and Southern Africa\u2019s climate and vegetation. \u25a0Water and minerals are vital resources in East and Southern Africa. Key Terms and Places rift valley Great Rift Valley escarpment Mount Kilimanjaro Serengeti Plain veld Namib Desert droughtsIf YOU lived there . . . You and your friends are planning to hike up Mount Kilimanjaro, near the equator in Tanzania. It is ho t in your camp at the base of the mountain. You\u2019re wearing shorts and a T-shirt, but your guide tells you to pack a fleece jacket and jeans. You start your climb, and soon you understand this advice. The air is much colder, and there\u2019s snow on the nearby peaks. Why is it cold at the top of the mountain? Physical Features Geographically, East and Southern Africa are vast regions with spectacularly varied landscapes and wildlife. On a visit to the region, you might see steep mountains, deep gorges, lakes, and a series of plateaus featuring dry grasslands, sandy savannas, and deserts. Rift Valleys Locate the Great Rift Valley on the physical map of East and Southern Africa. Seen from the air, the Great Rift Valley looks like a giant scar, cutting across Africa from the Red Sea to Mozambique. A rift valley is a long narrow valley with flat floors and steep walls. Rift valleys form when Earth\u2019s tectonic plates pull away from one another at two parallel fault lines. When the plates pull apart, the land between the faults drops down, forming a valley floor. The Great Rift Valley is the largest rift on Earth. In fact, it extends beyond Africa, northward into Syria, and contains many rifts. In Africa, the Great Rift Valley is made up of two rifts\u2014the eastern rift and the western rift. The steep rift walls form a series of high cliffs. These cliffs rise as much as 6,000 feet (1,829 m). The rifts contain a number of active and dor- mant volcanoes and are lined by plateaus and mountains. Plateaus and Mountains East and Southern Africa have many high plateaus. Plateaus are extensive areas of flat upland. Often they are bound by an escarpment, a steep slope that separates the plateau from surrounding low-lying land. Some plateaus are bound by mountains.

Location What major ocean borders East Africa? 2. Human-Environment Interaction How might physi- cal features shape settlement patterns in Botswana?Much of Ethiopia is a rugged landscape called the Ethiopian Highlands. Most of the country\u2019s people live in this fertile area. In northern Botswana, the Okavango River forms an enormous inland delta. Most of Southern Africa lies on a plateau. Parts of this plateau reach more than 4,000 feet (1,219 m) above sea level. The land drops sharply toward coastal areas. In South Africa, the southeastern part of the escarpment is made up of a mountain range called the Drakensberg (DRAH-kuhnz-buhrk). The peaks rise as high as 11,425 feet (3,482 m). Farther north, another mountain range, the Inyanga (in-YANG-guh) Mountains, separates Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Southern Africa also has mountains along its western coast. The East African Plateau in parts of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda is higher than the plateau in Southern Africa. Rift valleys run north and south through this plateau. To the east, high volcanic mountains tower over the plateau. The highest mountain in Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro (ki- luh-muhn-JAHR-oh), rises to 19,340 feet (5,895 m). Despite Kilimanja ro\u2019s location near the equator, the mountain\u2019s peak has long been covered in snow. This much colder climate is caused by Kilimanjaro\u2019s high elevation .1 2 21East and Southern Africa: Physical Module 25810 810 Module 25, Lesson 1 READING CHECK Describe What are East and Southern Africa\u2019s main physical features? rift valleys, plateaus with grassy plains, the Ethiopian Highlands, Mount Kilimanjaro, the Serengeti Plain, Lake Victoria, basin, inland delta, waterfalls ADVANCED/GIFTED Rivers of Southern Africa 1.

Interpret Charts About how many African elephants live in the wild today? 415,000 Reading Check Describe What are East and Southern Africa\u2019s main physical features?Farther north, the Ethiopian Highlands form another significant plateau region. Deep river valleys cut through these mountainous and rugged highlands. Plains Grassy plains cover wide expanses of the plateaus in East and Southern Africa. For example, plains stretch as far as the eye can see along the eastern rift in Tanzania and Kenya. Wildlife thrives on Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti Plain, one of the region\u2019s largest plains. The plain\u2019s grasses, trees, and water provide nutrition for elephants, giraffes, lions, ch eetahs, and zebras. To protect its wildlife, Tanzania established a national par k. Southern Africa\u2019s narrow coastal area and wide plateaus are also covere d with grassy plains. These flat plains are home to animals such as lions, leopards, elephants, baboons, and antelope. Rivers and Lakes East Africa has a number of rivers and large lakes. The world\u2019s longest river, the Nile, begins in East Africa. The Nile is formed by the meeting of the Blue Nile and the White Nile at Khartoum, Sudan. The White Nile flows from Africa\u2019s largest lake, Lake Victoria. The Blue Nile forms from waters that run down from Ethiopia\u2019s highlands. As the Nile flows north to the Mediterranean Sea, its banks provide a narrow but extremely fertile strip of land beyond which there is only desert. Several large rivers cross Southern Africa\u2019s plains. The Okavango River flows from Angola into a huge basin in Botswana. There, it forms a swampy inland delta that is home to crocodiles, zebras, hippos, and other animals. Many tourists travel to Botswana to see these wild animals in their natural habitat. The Orange River passes through the rocky Augrabies (oh-KRAH-bees) Falls as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean. During the rainy season, the water cascades down 19 separate waterfalls with a thunderous roar. Features such as waterfalls block ships from sailing up these rivers. Still, in an otherwise dry area, these rivers provide farme rs with a source of water to irrigate farmland. Climate and Vegetation When you think of Africa, do you think of a hot or a cold place? Wet or dry? Many people think all of Africa is hot and dry. However, East and Southern Africa are home to a variety of climate and vegetation types, including some that might surprise you. Highlands Compared to other equatorial regions, East Africa is cool and dry. This is due to high elevations and a rain shadow effect that prevents wet weather from entering into the region from the west. The plateaus and mountains north of the equator have a cool, highland climate and dense forests. The highlands experience heavier rainfall th an the low-lying, drier valleys in the region. This mild climate makes farming possible. As a result, most of the region\u2019s population lives in the highlands. Savanna and Deserts A large savanna region extends south from the equator, covering much of East and Southern Africa. Shrubs and short trees grow on the grassy plains of the savanna. In South Africa, these open Academic Vocabulary features characteristics East and Southern Africa 811 East and Southern Africa 811 READING CHECK Summarize What is the climate like in East and Southern Africa?

To the veld\u2019s west, the savanna gives way to steppe and desert climates. Vegetation is limited to shrubs and hardy grasses that are adapted to water shortages. Strictly speaking, Southern Africa\u2019s Kalahari Desert is not a desert. Rather, it is a huge sandy savanna that covers most of Botswana and parts of South Africa and Namibia. In the north, where it gets enough rain, the Kalahari\u2019s sandy plains support grasses and scattered shrubs and trees. In the southwest, the Kalahari merges with the Namib Desert on the Atlantic coast of Southern Africa. Some parts of the Namib get as little as a half inch (13 mm) of rainfall per year. In this dry area, plants get water from dew and fog rather than from rain. Tropical Forests Unlike the mainland, Madagascar has lush vegetation and tropical forests. It also has many animals found nowhere else. For example, some 50 species of lemurs, relatives of apes, live only on this island. However, the destruction of Madagascar\u2019s forests has endange red many of the island\u2019s animals. Resources Water is a vital resource for human health, wildlife, and industry in East and Southern Africa. Rivers supply hydroelectricity and water for irrig a- tion. Where rain is plentiful or irrigation is possible, farmers can grow a wide range of crops. However, water is not distributed evenly across East and Southern Africa.

Possible answer: The landscape is dry and has few plants; people are lined up to collect water. Reading Check Describe What resources are found in East and Southern Africa?pollution place additional stress on already limited water supplies. As a result, many people living in these countries have little or no access to safe drinking water. Seasonal droughts are also common in East and Southern Africa. Droughts are periods when little rain falls and crops are damaged. During a drought, crops and the grasses for cattle die and people begin to starve. Several times in recent decades, droughts have affected the people of East and Southern Africa. In recent years, significant discoveries of gas and oil resources have bee n made in East and Southern Africa. In 2012, one of the world\u2019s largest natu- ral gas deposits was discovered in Mozambique. Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya are also rich in gas and oil resources. Southern Africa is abundant in other natural resources as well. Mada- gascar\u2019s forests provide timber. The region\u2019s most valuable resources, however, are minerals. Mines in South Africa produce most of the world\u2019s gold. In addition, South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia have productive diamond mines. Other mineral resources in Southern Africa include coa l, platinum, copper, uranium, and iron ore. Although mining is very impor- tant to regional economies, the mines and the pollution they produce have damaging effects on surrounding natural environments.

Its grasses, trees, and water provide the nutrition needed to support vast amounts of wildlife, including elephants, giraffes, and lions. 5. Draw Conclusions How can humans protect the animals of Madagascar? Explain your answer. Humans can protect the animals of Madagascar by slowing or stopping the destruction of the island\u2019s forests. This is because the destruction of these forests is endangering many of the island\u2019s animals. 6. Draw Conclusions Why might some people oppose the development of East and Southern Africa\u2019s mineral resources? Although this region has a wealth of mineral resources, developing them has negative consequences. For example, mining results in pollution, which damages surrounding natural environments. 813a Module 25, Lesson 1 continued from page 810continued from page 813 continued from page 809 STRUGGLING READERS Matching Text Descriptions with Map Features 1.

Connect to Science: Melting Ice The area of the ice pack on Mount Kilimanjaro has shrunk about 85 percent between 1912 and 2011. In 1912 the ice pack measured 4.6 square miles. By 2000 it had shrunk to just 1 square mile. At this rate, scientists worry that the tropical glacier will melt away completely within the next 20 to 50 years. Some scientists think that global warming is one cause, but global warming alone cannot explain the rapid change. This shrinkage of the ice pack will threaten tourism, the supply of drinking water, irrigation, and the production of hydroelectric power. Connect to Arts and the Humanities: Mountain Gallery The Drakensberg is South Africa\u2019s highest mountain range. Its mountaintops have a layer of basalt, with sandstone underneath. This creates steep- sided blocks and peaks\u2014with many caves found in the sandstone. In some of these caves, thousands of images of rock art can be found. The art was created by the indigenous San people who lived in the mountains for about 4,000 years.More About . . . Diamond Mining in South Africa Diamonds were first discovered in South Africa in the nation\u2019s Kimberley region in 1866, when a 15-year-old boy found the famous 21.25-carat Eureka diamond along the Orange River. By the 1880s the Kimberley region was supplying 95 percent of the world\u2019s diamonds. South Africa has produced some of the largest and most famous diamonds ever found, including the Cullinan diamond, the largest-ever gem-quality rough diamond at 3,106.45 carats. Though it is thought that most of South Africa\u2019s diamonds have now been mined, the country remains a significant world supplier of the gem, especially of fancy color diamonds such as pink and blue\u2014including a 122.45-carat blue diamond discovered in 2014. In 2014 South Africa was the world\u2019s fifth-largest diamond producer by value, mining 7.4 million carats worth $1.22 billion. SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS Water: A Vital Resource 1.

Slaves were used as porters to carry huge elephant tusks from the interior to the coast. Some were so heavy that it took four people to carry a single tusk. Connect to Today: Endangered Elephants The slave trade ended in Zanzibar in 1873, but the ivory trade was not outlawed until 1975. Between the early 1970s and 1990, poachers reduced the number of elephants in Africa from around 2 million to about 600,000. Governments began prosecuting poachers, and elephant herds have expanded.

Although you and your friends learn En glish in school, you speak the African language of Swahili t o each other. How has your country\u2019s history affected your life today? History Many historical forces have shaped East Africa. Top among these are religion, imperialism, and independence m ovements. Religion Christian missionaries from Egypt brought Christian - ity to East Africa as early as the AD 300s. Over ti me, Ethiopian Christianity developed its own unique traditions th at blended with local African customs. In the early 1200s a po werful Chris- tian emperor named Lalibela ruled Ethiopia. Lalibel a is best known for building 11 rock churches, which are stil l in use today. By about AD 700, Islam was a major religion in North Africa. Gradually, Muslim Arabs from Egypt spread Islam into north- ern Sudan. At the same time, Muslim city-states, such as Moga- dishu and Mombasa, developed along the East African coast. These coastal cities became Islamic centers and grew wealthy from overseas trade. Trade and Slavery East Africa\u2019s coastal cities linked foreign merchants with goods from Africa\u2019s interior. These merchants brought goods such as glassware, porcelain, and sil k to Africa. They departed with coconut oil, copper, leopard ski ns, ivory, and gold. In addition, enslaved Africans captured in th e interior were exported through coastal cities to markets in Arabi a, Persia, and India. By the early 1500s the Portuguese had bu ilt forts and settlements along East Africa\u2019s coast to support th e slave trade. In the late 1700s the island of Zanzibar became an international slave-trading center. Later, Zanzibar\u2019s slave popul ation was forced to harvest cloves and other spices on planta tions.

Place Which East African nation remained independent from European rule? Ethiopia Reading Check Explain How did nationalist movements impact Kenya?European Imperialism As European countries industrialized, their need for raw materials rose sharply. To meet this demand, they turned to other world regions. In Africa, they claimed lands to gain access to gold, ivory, rubber, and other natural resources. Building an empire by claiming land s, setting up colonies, and controlling those areas is called imperialism. European powers competed with each other to control Africa. The Brit- ish gained control over much of East Africa. In 1884 European leaders met to divide Africa among themselves. They drew boundaries that split some ethnic groups apart. In other areas, unfriendly groups were lumped together. To maintain power, colonial rulers appointed African deputi es. Many deputies were African chiefs, who favored their own peoples. This practice contributed to ethnic rivalries. After 1945, nationalist movements formed across Africa. They pressed for self-rule. Some efforts turned violent. In the 1950s a militant nation al- ist group in Kenya called the Mau Mau used violence and terror to resist British rule. The British fought back with brutal force, eventually defe ating the Mau Mau. After eight years of conflict, an estimated 11,000 Mau Mau and just 32 white settlers were killed. Still, by the 1960s Kenya, like most other nations in East Africa, gained its independence. Culture East Africa\u2019s history has contributed to its present-day cultural div ersity. Today, the region is home to a variety of languages and religions. Language Hundreds of languages are spoken in East Africa. With about 80 million speakers, Swahili is the most widely spoken language.

East Africa Today The nations in East Africa\u2019s Great Rift Valley are rich in natural resources\u2014 including wildlife\u2014but people disagree about the be st way to use them. Droughts can make life here difficult. In addition, political and ethnic con- flicts have led to unrest and violence in some area s of the region. Kenya and Tanzania Though Kenya and Tanzania are among the world\u2019s poorest nations, both are popular tourist destinations. With nearly 3 mil- lion visitors each year, tourism is a major source of income for both coun- tries. Many tourists visit to go on a safari, an overland journey to view African wildlife. Agriculture dominates Kenya\u2019s economy. Kenya\u2019s rich volcanic soil sustains crops of coffee, flowers, and tea that are grown fo r exports.

They return to the southeastern plains at the end of the dry season, in November. AIDS Prevention Around 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV. Of these, approximately 25.4 million live in sub-Saharan Africa. In East Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda have the largest number of affected people. In the 1990s Uganda implemented strong AIDS prevention campaigns and was able to lower its estimated HIV infection rate to around 5 percent from nearly 14 percent in the early 1990s. In spite of this progress, by 2016 more than a million people in Uganda were living with AIDS, and approximately 970,000 children under age 17 have lost one or both parents. Kenya\u2019s economy also benefits from geothermal energy, energy produced from the heat of Earth\u2019s interior. This heat\u2014in the form of extremely hot steam\u2014comes up to the surface through cracks in the rift valleys. Tanzania is particularly rich in gold and diamonds. However, it is still a poor country of mainly subsistence farmers. Poor soils and limited tech- nology have restricted the nation\u2019s productivity. Both Kenya and Tanzania boast vibrant modern cities with colorful outdoor markets, soaring skyscrapers, and beautiful parks. Kenya\u2019s cap ital, Nairobi, also serves as the country\u2019s industrial center. Nairobi is wel l con- nected to the rest of East Africa by a network of railways. By rail, Kenyans transport tea and other crops to Mombasa, a major port city on Kenya\u2019s coast. Tanzania\u2019s largest city and business center is Dar es Salaam, a port city on the Indian Ocean with about 5 million people. Even though Kenya and Tanzania are peaceful countries, Dar es Salaam and Nairobi have both endured terrorist attacks. In 1998 members of the al-Qaeda terrorist group bombed the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. Most of the more than 250 people killed and the thousands injured were Africans.

Since 1984 the Janjaweed has killed an estimated 1.5 million Christians. From 2003 to 2008 the Janjaweed killed hundreds of thousands of ethnically African Sudane se in a region called Darfur. Millions more fled Darfur as refugees. In 2011 South Sudan gained independence, becoming Africa\u2019s newest country. South Sudan\u2019s population is mostly African and follows animis t or Christian faiths. Today, Uganda is still recovering from several decades of military dictatorship. Since 1986 Uganda has become more democratic, but eco- nomic progress has been slow. About 80 percent of Uganda\u2019s workforce is employed in agriculture, with coffee as the country\u2019s major export. Rwanda and Burundi Rwanda and Burundi are two of the most densely populated countries in all of Africa. Both are located in fertile highlands and share a history as German and, later, Belgian colonies. Rwanda and Burundi are populated by two main ethnic groups\u2014the Tutsi and the Hutu. Since gaining independence from Belgium, these nations have expe- rienced ethnic conflict, much of which is rooted in the national borders drawn by Europeans that ignored or split traditional ethnic territories . In the 1990s hatred between the Hutu and the Tutsi led to genocide in Rwanda. A genocide is the intentional destruction of a people. The Hutu tried to completely wipe out the Tutsi. Armed bands of Hutu killed hun- dreds of thousands of Tutsi.CountryPopulation Density (per square mile) Burundi 1,083 Kenya 209 Rwanda 1,329 Sudan 50 Tanzania 149 Uganda 487 United States 91 Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2016Interpret Maps 1.

Ethiopia vs. Eritrea A border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea was supposed to be resolved when both countries signed a peace agreement in 2000. But relations between the two countries continue to be unstable, and fighting on the Ethiopian-Eritrean border has continued for more than 16 years. Food Shortages In 2017, after six years of drought and civil war that killed more than 250,000 people in Somalia, the government declared a state of emergency due to famine. The lack of rain for an extended period affected more than 6 million people and killed the livestock on which many depend for survival. LINK TO MATHEMATICS Create a Cartogram 1. Tell students that there are a number of ways to display population data. One of these is with a cartogram, which displays quantitative data on a map that is not true to scale. Show examples of cartograms from an atlas or a website. 2. Have students find population figures for East Africa. Have them work with a partner to create a cartogram illustrating the relative populations for these countries.3. Have students compare their cartograms. Then have them compare their cartograms with the East Africa: Population map and table and draw conclusions about East Africa\u2019s population. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 20: Map Creation; and 30: Research The Horn of Africa Four East African countries along the Red Sea and t he Indian Ocean are called the Horn of Africa. On a map, these countrie s\u2014Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, and Ethiopia\u2014resemble the horn of a rhinoc eros. For many years, the Horn of Africa has been one of the world\u2019s most troubled regions. Eritrea Eritrea\u2019s path to independence has been long. A former Italian and British colony, Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia in the 1960s. In 1992, after 32 years of armed conflict, Eritrea finally gained independence. H ow- ever, independence did not bring peace. Bloody clashes with Yemen and neighbors Djibouti and Ethiopia have followed. In recent years, Eritrea has been widely criticized as one the world\u2019s most secretive states and for its human rights abuses. In 2015 more than 26,000 Eritrean refugees between the ages of 18 and 34 fled to Europe. Thousands more fled to other countries. Djibouti Located on a narrow strait connecting the Red Sea a nd the Indian Ocean, Djibouti (ji-BOO-tee) is a small, desert cou ntry. The strait lies along a major shipping route. The country\u2019s capital and maj or port is also called Dji- bouti. Since Djibouti has few resources, the port i s a major source of income. Though it gained independence from France in 1977, Djibouti continues to receive economic and military support from France. Djibouti is home to two major ethnic groups\u2014the Issa and the Afar. The Issa are closely related to the people of Somalia. The Afar are related to the people of Ethiopia. Members of both groups are Muslim. In the early 1990s a civil war between the Afar and Issa broke out. In 2001 the two groups signed a peace treaty, which ended the fighting. Somalia Somalia\u2019s deserts and dry savannas are not suitable for farm- ing. Still, its economy relies heavily on agriculture. Major crops incl ude bananas, sorghum, and rice. Many Somalis are nomadic herders, and fish- ing is also important.Children in East Africa face many barriers to education, including poverty, war, gender inequality, and a lack of schools. Sudan has one of the highest out-of-school rates in the region. Nearly 3 million Sudanese children do not attend school, and girls are often specifically excluded. As a result, Sudan\u2019s literacy rate is 83 percent for males and 69 percent for females. By contrast, Kenya has made education a priority for all students. Its literacy rate is 81 percent for males and 75 percent for females.

Ask students to find literature about East Africa in the library or on the Internet. Literature might include Ernest Hemingway\u2019s short story \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro, \u201d his memoir Green Hills of Africa, Isak Dinesen\u2019s novel Out of Africa, or Beryl Markham\u2019s memoir West with the Night. Encourage them to investigate literature by East African authors as well, such as Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, Grace Ogot, Rebeka Njau, Ismael Mbise, Nuruddin Farah, David Rubadiri, and J. N. Mwaura.2. Have students write reports about their reading, addressing this question: What does the work reveal about the legacy of colonialism in East Africa? 3. Have volunteers read their reports aloud. Encourage them to share their personal responses to the literature. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 12: Drawing Conclusions; and 41: Writing to ExpressPrint Assessment Review Ideas, Terms, and Places 1. a.

Define What is genocide? the intentional destruction of a people b. Compare and Contrast How have recent conflicts in Rwanda and Sudan been similar and different? Possible answer: similarities: ethnic differences fueled conflict, massive death tolls; differences: In Rwanda, Tutsis experienced a genocide. In Sudan, African Sudanese and Christians were targets of violence and the country split into two. c. Analyze Why are millions of Sudanese refugees? They were displaced when an Arab militia group in Darfur began attacking them. 4. a. Recall What two major world religions are practiced in Ethiopia? Islam, Christianity b. Analyze How do you think Djibouti\u2019s location has helped its economy? Possible answers: It lies on a major shipping route; its port is a major source of income. Most Somalis are Muslim, ethnically Somali, and speak the Somali language. Despite these shared cultural traits, Somalia has been torn apart by chaos and violence. Somalia has no central government of any kind. Different clans fight over grazing rights and control of port cit- ies such as Mogadishu. In the 1990s Somalis experienced wide- spread starvation caused by a civil war and a severe drought. The United Nations sent aid and troops to the country. Since the civil war, Somali pirates have terrorized the coast, cap- turing cargo ships and demanding millions of dollars in ransom money. Ethiopia Landlocked Ethiopia is the only nation in the Horn of Africa to have escaped European colonization. In addition to providing a natural defense, Ethiopia\u2019s mountains and highlands have rich, volcanic soil. A gri- culture is the nation\u2019s chief economic activity. Many people also herd shee p and cattle. Top exports include coffee, vegetables, livestock, and oilsee ds. Long periods of severe drought have affected all of the nations in the Horn of Africa. In 2011 East Africa faced what many called the worst drought in 60 years. The drought killed crops, caus ing a severe food crisis for about 9.5 million people living in Ethiopia, Somali a, Kenya, and Djibouti.

Make Inferences Why were the British willing to endure violent conflict with the Mau Mau to maintain control of Kenya? The British established a colony in Kenya to fuel their industrial economy. They were willing to endure violent conflict with the Mau Mau because of the economic benefits of maintaining colonial control of this area of Africa. 6. Compare and Contrast How is religion in Ethiopia and Sudan similar and different? Describe one similarity and one difference. Most people in these two countries are either Christian or Muslim, and Christianity and Islam both began outside of Africa. Most Ethiopians are Christian, while most Sudanese are Muslim. 7. Cause and Effect How did Europeans contribute to modern-day problems in Rwanda and Burundi? Europeans drew national borders in Africa that ignored or split traditional ethnic territories. In modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, this led to conflict between these countries\u2019 two main ethnic groups, the Tutsi and the Hutu. 8. Draw Conclusions Why does Djibouti continue to receive economic aid from France? Djibouti is a small, desert country whose capital and major port, which is also called Djibouti, is a major source of income. However, the country has few resources and therefore still receives aid from France.

Recall What discovery by archaeologists suggests that Africa and East Asia were connected by an Indian Ocean trade network? Chinese porcelain and other artifacts found at Great Zimbabwe Explain What brought Portuguese traders to Southern Africa in the 1400s? To get to Asia from Portugal to trade for spices, traders had to sail around the southern tip of Africa. Because the trip was long and difficult, they set up bases on the Southern African coast. Define What is Afrikaans? a mixture of the Dutch language with Khoisan and Bantu words Who were the Boers? Afrikaner frontier farmers who spread out from the original Cape colony and resisted the British Recall When did South Africa move away from the apartheid system? in the 1980s What happened in 1994? Nelson Mandela was elected president of South Africa after South Africans of all races were able to vote. More About . . . Great Zimbabwe The ruins of Great Zimbabwe span nearly 1,800 acres and cover an area of 100 to 200 miles (160\u2013320 km). Archaeologists believe the ancient city reveals a social hierarchy. For example, the more elaborate structures that were situated further away from the center of the city were built for kings. Many believe the placement far from the city was to escape the tsetse fly\u2014and disease. If YOU lived there . . . You are an economic adviser in Botswana. In recent years, your country has made progress toward improv- ing people\u2019s lives, but you think there is room for improvement. Botswana already has amazing natural landscapes and fascinating animals. One way you plan to help the economy is by promoting tourism. What could your country do to attract more tourists? History Southern Africa\u2019s earliest people belonged to a language group called the Khoisan. The Khoisan were hunter-gatherers and herders. About 2,000 years ago, Bantu-speaking people from West and Central Africa joined them. The Bantus\u2019 knowledge of farming and iron working helped make them the dominant group in the region. Much later, Europeans arrived and forever changed Southern Africa and its people. Great Zimbabwe One Bantu group, the Shona, built an empire that peaked in the 1400s. The Shona farmed, raised cattle, and traded gold with other groups on the coast. Their empire included much of what is now Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The Shona are best known for Great Zimbabwe, their stone-walled capital. Founded in the late 1000s, Great Zimbabwe was a small trading and herding center. In the 1100s the population grew, as did gold mining and farming. These resources helped the city become the center of a large trading network. At its peak, Great Zimbabwe may have had 10,000 to 20,000 residents. Archaeologists have found Chinese porcelain and glass beads from India at Great Zimbabwe. Such artifacts suggest the Shona traded with the Swahili, who lived on the East African coast. Through the Swahili, the Shona were connected to an Indian Ocean trade network. Trade made Great Zimbabwe\u2019s rulers wealthy and powerful. However, in the 1400s the gold trade declined. Deprived of its main source of wealth, Great Zimbabwe weakened. By 1500 it was no longer a capital and trading center.Lesson 3 Southern Africa The Big Idea Since independence, nations in Southern Africa have struggled with inequality and conflict. Main Ideas \u25a0Southern Africa\u2019s history began with hunter-gatherers, fol- lowed by great empires and European settlements. \u25a0The cultures of Southern Africa are rich in different languages, religions, customs, and art. \u25a0The countries of Southern Africa are diverse in their resources and governments. \u25a0Today, the people of Southern Africa face economic, environ- mental, and health challenges.

When students have finished, review the answers with the entire class. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 13: Graphic Organizers European Colonization In the late 1400s Portuguese traders explored Southern Africa on their way to Asia. The trip was long and difficult, so traders set up bases on the Southern African coast. These bases provided ships with supplies. In 1652 the Dutch East India Company set up a trade station at a natural harbor near the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape sits at the tip of Africa. Its mild climate was similar to the climate the Dutch were used to in the Netherlands. The Cape Colony provided supplies for Dutch ships sailing between the East Indies and the Netherlands. In 1657 the company allowed some workers to start their own farms. These farmers became known as Boers. The arrival of Europeans devastated local populations. Many died of diseases, such as small pox. The survivors fought the colonists or became their slaves or servants. More European settlers\u2014Dutch, French, and German\u2014soon arrived on the Cape. These settlers and their descendants were called Afrikaners. Over time, a new language called Afrikaans emerged in the Cape Colony. Afrikaans combined Dutch with Khoisan and Bantu words. German, French, and English also influenced the language\u2019s development. In the early 1800s the British took control of the Cape. They clashed with the Boers. Many Boers packed their belongings into wagons and moved east and north. Those moving north were intruders in Zulu territory. The Zulu were a Bantu-speaking group and the mightiest fighting force in Southern Africa. The Boers and the Zulu fought over land. Great Zimbabwe Highly skilled craftspeople built several stone walls that surrounded the Shona capital of Great Zimbabwe. Today, the ruins are a World Heritage Site. Analyze Visuals Why do you think Great Zimbabwe was made of stone? Module 25822 822 Module 25, Lesson 3 COLLABORATIVE LEARNING History Detectives 1. Divide the class into groups of three or four. Have each group select one major event in Southern Africa\u2019s history mentioned in the section. For example, students could choose to learn more about the arrival of the Boers, how Great Britain took over the area of the Cape, or how a specific Southern African country gained independence. 2. Have each group work together to research the event, create a map showing the area affected, create other visuals, and organize a presentation describing the event.3. Have groups give their presentations to the class. Encourage other students to offer their feedback after each presentation. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 24: Oral Presentations; and 30: Research ONLINE ANALYZE VIDEOS Nelson Mandela Have students watch the video individually or as a class.

Possible answer: Mandela changed his views in 1960 after 69 peaceful black protesters were killed by white South African police. ONLINE INTERACTIVE CHARTS Colonialism and Independence in Southern Africa Have students explore the chart using the interactive features and answer the associated question. Interpret Charts Which country in Southern Africa was the last to gain independence? Namibia Eventually, the British wanted Zulu land, too. The British also set their eyes on the rich deposits of gold and diamonds that Afrikaners in the interior of the country controlled. After a series of battles, the Britis h defeated the Zulu. And, in 1902, after eight years of war, the British defeated the Boers. Independence After the Zulu and Boer wars, Great Britain granted inde- pendence to South Africa in 1910. The new nation united former British and Boer colonies but was under white minority rule. Black South Africans were denied voting rights. Other Southern African nations began gaining independence in the 1960s. For some, the struggle was long and violent. For example, Africans resisted colonization in Rhodesia. After white colonists declared th eir own white-dominated republic in 1970, fighting between whites and Africa ns continued. Finally, in 1980 the Africans won independence and renamed their country Zimbabwe. Despite violent resistance, Namibia continue d to be ruled by South Africa until 1990. Mozambique was granted indepen- dence in 1975, after ten years of war against Portuguese rule. Apartheid in South Africa In the early 1900s white South Africans controlled South Africa\u2019s government and excluded black South Afric ans from power. To defend their rights, black South Africans formed the African National Congress (ANC) in 1912. In the late 1940s racial inequality in South Africa grew worse. The government set up a policy called apartheid to separate whites and nonwhites. This policy divided people into four groups: whites, blacks, coloureds, and Asians. Apartheid placed harsh controls on nonwhites , especially blacks. Blacks were denied citizenship, the right to vote, and t he ability to hold political offices. Housing, health care, and schools for bla cks were poor compared to those for whites. Moreover, blacks were restricted to certain occupations and poor pay.This painting by artist Charles Bell (1813\u20131882) shows the 1652 arrival of Dutch settlers in Table Bay, near the Cape of Good Hope.

Most of these areas lacked farmland, mines, and other natural resources. In cities, blacks had to live in separa te areas called townships, crowded clusters of tiny homes. The townships were far from the jobs in the cities and mines. In South Africa, many groups, including the ANC, op posed apartheid. Internal protests took the form of boycotts, strike s, marches, and occasional violence. Opposition also came from the internation al community. The United States and other nations applied sanctions \u2014economic or political penalties imposed to force a change in policy\u2014on So uth Africa. Some countries banned trade or refused to invest their m oney in South Africa. In addition, the Olympics banned South Africa from par ticipation for nearly 30 years. In the late 1980s the efforts of the ANC and anti-apartheid protesters contributed to social and political change. In 1990 and 1991, South Africa repealed all of its apartheid laws. The country held its first free, multira cial election in 1994, awarding the presidency to ANC leader Nelson Mandela. In 1996 South Africa adopted a new constitution, guaranteeing basic freedoms to all of its citizens. Culture Over time, many groups created a diverse culture in Southern Africa. Today, the region\u2019s culture reflects both African and European influences. People The people of Southern Africa belong to hundreds of different ethnic groups. Some groups are very large. For example, about 11 million people in South Africa are Zulu. Nearly 1.6 million of Botswana\u2019s 2 million people belong to a single ethnic group, the Tswana. Other ethnic groups are small, and some trace their heritage to other world regions. For example, about 6 percent of Namibia\u2019s population is of European descent. The Malagasy people in Madagascar are a mix of 18 small ethnic groups whose ancestors migrated across the Indian Ocean from Indonesia.Reading Check Form Generalizations How did European colonization impact independence movements in Southern Africa?Nelson Mandela 1918\u20132013 Because he protested against apartheid, Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years.
