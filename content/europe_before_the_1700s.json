Nobles built castles for protection, such as the Eilean Donan castle in this photo, and to control the land around them. Culture Tell the students that ancient civilizations flourished in ancient Greece more than 2,000 years ago. Ask them to imagine that they are living there. Ask them what they think their lives would be like. Politics Tell students that knights protected their lords in exchange for land. Ask students why they think lords needed knights for protection. Society The Roman Catholic Church played a major role in the lives of Europeans during the Middle Ages. Ask students why they think a medieval monk would challenge the Church. Analyze Visuals What do the cave painting and Michelangelo\u2019s David say about the differences and similarities between prehistoric and Renaissance cultures? Possible answer: Prehistoric people seem concerned with survival, whereas people during the Renaissance seem more focused on ideas and history; both created art to express what was important to them.

Ask: What do you think this expression means? Possible answer: to understand what someone is telling us without it being directly stated Encourage students to share examples of when they needed to \u201cread between the lines\u201d in their everyday lives. Continue on to explain that authors sometimes do not state main ideas directly. We have to read the details and then draw conclusions based on these details. Drawing these conclusions allows us to see the \u201cbig picture. \u201d Y ou Try It! 1. What is the topic? how Theodora helped Justinian 2. What are the facts and details? convinced him to stay, gave him advice, Justinian\u2019s soldiers killed rioters 3. What is the main idea? Theodora helped save the emperor\u2019s throne. YOU TRY IT! Read the following sentences. Notice the main idea is not stated. Using the three steps described above, develop a statement that expresses the main idea of the paragraph.Understand Implied Main Ideas READING FOCUS Do you ever \u201cread between the lines\u201d when people say things? You understand what people mean even when they don\u2019t come right out and say it. You can do the same thing with writing. Writers don\u2019t always state the main idea directly, but you can find clues to the main idea in the details. To understand an implied main idea, first read the text carefully and think about the topic. Next, look at the facts and details and ask yourself what the paragraph is saying. Then create a statement that sums up the main idea. Notice the way this process works with the paragraph below.Reading Social Studies As you read this module, practice understanding the implied main ideas.1. What is the topic? Jesus as a young man 3. What is the main idea? Jesus lived the typical life of a young Jewish man.2. What are the facts and details? \u2022 lived in Nazareth \u2022 studied to be a carpenter \u2022 learned about Judaism As a young man Jesus lived in the town of Nazareth and probably stud- ied with Joseph to become a carpenter. Like many young Jewish men of the time, Jesus also studied the laws and teachings of Judaism. By the time he was about 30, Jesus had begun to travel and teach. Justinian was stopped from leaving by his wife, Theodora. She convinced Justinian to stay in the city. Smart and powerful, Theodora helped her hus- band rule effectively. With her advice, he found a way to end the riots. Jus- tinian\u2019s soldiers killed all the rioters\u2014 some 30,000 people\u2014and saved the emperor\u2019s throne. 362 Module 12 362 Module 12 LESSON 1 Big Idea Prehistoric people adapted to their environment and developed agriculture.Early Hominids Hunter-gatherers A Mammoth House Early Domestication Game: The Life of Early Humans Mapping Early Human Migration Prehistoric Communities Early Domestication and Neolithic Settlement Key Terms Review Reading Check Graphic Organizer Activity Lesson AssessmentDocument-Based Investigation: Lascaux Cave PaintingsMap: Early Human Migration Table: Early HominidsThe Ice Age StonehengeLesson 1 Planner Prehistoric Cultures VisualsMaps, Graphs, and ChartsVideos AssessmentExtend and EnrichSources Europe before the 1700s 362a Online Lesson 1 Enrichment Activities Early Domestication and Neolithic Settlement Article Students read an article describing the changes that took place during the Neolithic revolution, including the creation of settled human communities. Students then explain how agriculture changed these people\u2019s lives and consider similar changes in today\u2019s world. Prehistoric Communities Article Students read about the archeological remains discovered in Jericho. Students then imagine they are archeologists in AD 5001 who are excavating their hometown. Students determine what artifacts they might uncover and how they might figure out what these artifacts would used for. Mapping Early Human Migration Article Students read about how scientists have studied human migration and developed two main theories concerning how modern humans have spread throughout the world. Students then conduct additional research and create their own maps showing how human migration might have occurred in Africa, Asia, and Europe. 362b Module 12, Lesson 1 Teach the Main Idea Scientists study the remains of early humans to learn about prehistory. Identify What determines whether a specific time is prehistory? It came before humans were able to write. Explain During the Paleolithic Era, how would an individual have made a hand ax? The individual would have made it out of flint or another kind of stone and would have shaped it by striking it with another stone to make a sharp, jagged edge. Compare and Contrast How is a hunter- gather different from a farmer? A hunter- gatherer collects wild plants, seeds, nuts, etc., and hunts wild animals, whereas a farmer grows crops and domesticates animals.Understand Cause and Effect What are some of the reasons that scientists believe humans developed language? Possible answers: to make hunting in groups easier, to help form relationships, to help resolve issues like the distribution of food More About . . . Louis and Mary Leakey Two anthropologists in the forefront of learning about our prehistoric ancestors were Louis and Mary Leakey. Mary met Louis in 1933, and she joined him in Africa to draw stone tools he had found during his archaeological expeditions. Mary made an important discovery when she found a set of footprints that were 3.6 million years old. The footprints proved that ancestors of humans had walked upright. Together, Mary and Louis found three different sets of fossils, each believed to be a human ancestor. ONLINE DOCUMENT-BASED INVESTIGATION Europe before the 1700s Lascaux Cave Painting is the first of six document- based investigations in Europe before the 1700s. Students will view the image of paintings that are 15,000 to 17,000 years old and consider what they reveal about the people who created them. Teach the Big Idea 1. Whole Class Open/Introduction If YOU lived there . . . How can you use these plants to help you stay warm? Review the scenario with students and lead a class discussion around responses to the question. You may wish to review the following points to frame your discussion. Consider the PROBLEMS with your current clothing: \u2022animal hides are difficult to keep on \u2022animal hides can be difficult to obtain. Consider what would be REQUIRED to make clothing from these fibers: \u2022need to get fibers out of the plant \u2022need large quantities of fibers \u2022need a way to create cloth from the fibers 2. Direct Teach Introduce the Big Idea: Prehistoric people adapted to their environment and developed agriculture. Ask students if they have ever heard the expression \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention. \u201d Encourage them to analyze whether they think this expression was true for prehistoric people. Discuss that the very survival of early people depended on their ability to adapt to their surroundings, especially as they migrated to new locations. 3. Practice/Assess/Inquire Ask students for other examples of how humans adapted to their environment. For example, they learned to use fire to cook food and for protection and to make tools t o be able to kill animals and prepare them for eating . 4. Explore (Collaborative Exploration) Discuss that planting crops rather than foraging for food was an important way people adapted. This led to the beginning of agriculture and an entirely new way of life. Encourage students to discuss ways they think agriculture improved lives. 5. Whole Group Close/Reflect Have students create a two-column table. The left column should list the adaptations people made and the right column should list the advantages of those adaptations. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 6: Cause and Effect; and 7: Charts For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. If YOU lived there . . . You are a hunter-gatherer in Europe about 34,000 years ago. Your tribe has just arrived to this new land, which is much colder than your old home. You wrap yoursel f in animal hides, but it is difficult to keep them on while you hunt. Strange tall plants with pale flowers fill the land around you. You notice a few have been ripped out of the ground. When you examine them, you see long, strong fibers inside their stalks. How can you use these plants to help you stay warm? Prehistoric Humans Although humans have lived on Earth for more than a million years, writing was not invented until about five thousand years ago. Historians call the time before there was writing prehis- tory. To study prehistory, historians rely on the work of archae- ologists and anthropologists. Historic time periods, on the other hand, are those for which information has been recorded with letters, words, or numbers. The earliest human ancestors, or hominids, may have first appeared in Africa about 4\u20135 million years ago. These homi- nids walked upright and had brains about one-third the size of modern humans. Over time, hominids developed larger brains, and each group of hominids was more advanced than the one before it. Scientists are not exactly sure when or where the first mod- ern humans lived. Many think that they first appeared in Africa about two hundred thousand years ago. Scientists call these people Homo sapiens , or \u201cwise man.\u201d Every person alive today belongs to this group.Lesson 1 Prehistoric Cultures The Big Idea Prehistoric people adapted to their environment and devel- oped agriculture.

Organize students into groups, one for each of the four major groups of hominids listed in the Early Hominids image carousel. Tell them they are going to create a poster about their hominid group. 2. The groups should assign each member a specific topic, such as: What did their hominids look like and how did they walk? When and where did they live? What kinds of skills did they have?3. Students should conduct research to learn more about their assigned topic. 4. Instruct students to create a poster describing their hominid. Encourage them to use drawings and color in their posters. 5. Place the posters where the entire class can see them. Encourage the class to compare the different groups. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 14: Group Activity; 28: Posters; and 30: Research ONLINE INTERACTIVE VISUALS Carousel: Early Hominids Have students navigate through the images and information about the four major groups of hominids that appeared in Africa between 200,000 and 5 million years ago.

ONLINE GRAPHIC ORGANIZER Prehistoric Cultures As students read the lesson, have them use the graphic organizer to take notes. Students can review their graphic organizer notes at the end of the lesson to answer the following question: Analyze Effects How did the development of tools, clothing, shelter, and agriculture change the way early humans lived? Possible answer: Tools allowed people to hunt for food; clothing and shelter protected people as they moved to colder climates; and agriculture allowed people to create permanent settlements and develop early economies, social order, and religious practices . For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. The First Tools The first humans and their ancestors lived during a long period of time called the Stone Age. To help in their studies, archaeologists divide the Stone Age into three periods based on the kinds of tools used at the time. To archaeologists, a tool is any handheld object that has been modified to help a person accomplish a task. The first part of the Stone Age is called the Paleolithic (pay-lee-uh-LI- thik) Era, or Old Stone Age. It lasted until about ten thousand years ago. During this time, people used stone tools. Scientists have found the oldest tools in Tanzania, a country in East Africa. These sharpened stones, about the size of an adult\u2019s fist, are about 2.6 million years old. Each stone had been struck with another rock to Early people worked together and used spears to hunt large animals.Early Hominids Four major groups of hominids appeared in Africa between about two hundred thousand and 5 million years ago. Each group was more advanced than the one before it and could use better tools.Quick Facts Australopithecus \u2022 Name means \u201csouthern ape\u201d \u2022 Appeared in Africa about 4\u20135 million years ago \u2022 Stood upright and walked on two legs \u2022 Brain was about one-third the size of modern humans Homo habilis \u2022 Name means \u201chandy man\u201d \u2022 Appeared in Africa about 2.4 million years ago \u2022 Used early stone tools for chopping and scraping \u2022 Brain was about half the size of modern humansHomo erectus \u2022 Name means \u201cupright man\u201d \u2022 Appeared in Africa about 1.5\u20132 million years ago \u2022 Used early stone tools like the hand ax \u2022 Learned to control fire \u2022 Migrated out of Africa to Asia and Europe Homo sapiens \u2022 Name means \u201cwise man\u201d \u2022 Appeared in Africa about 200,000 years ago \u2022 Migrated around the world \u2022 Same species as modern human beings \u2022 Learned to create fire and use a wide variety of tools \u2022 Developed language Module 12364 364 Module 12, Lesson 1 ADVANCED/GIFTED Early Human Ancestors 1. Have students use the library and the Internet to learn more about an early human ancestor that is not discussed in this lesson . They should work to answer questions such as: Where and how were they discovered? How are they different from previously discovered groups? How did they adapt to their environment?2. Have students prepare an oral presentation to share what they have learned with the class. Encourage students to include illustrations in their reports. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 24: Oral Presentations; and 30: Research ONLINE INTERACTIVE VISUALS Image with Hotspots: Hunter-gatherers Have students explore the scene showing hunter- gatherers by using the interactive hotspots.

This process left one unsharp- ened side that could be used as a handle. Scientists think that these first tools were mostly used to process food. The sharp edge could be used to cut, chop, or scrape roots, bones, or meat. Tools like these were used for about 2 million years. Later Tools Over time, people learned to make better tools. For example, they developed the hand ax. They often made this tool out of a mineral called flint. Flint is easy to shape, and tools made from it can be very sharp. People used hand axes to break tree limbs, to dig, and to cut animal hides. People also learned to attach wooden handles to tools. By attaching a wooden shaft to a stone point, for example, they invented the spear. Because a spear could be thrown, hunters no longer had to stand close to animals they were hunting. As a result, people could hunt larger animals. Among the animals hunted by Stone Age people were deer, horses, bison, and elephant-like creatures called mammoths. Society As early humans developed tools and new hunting techniques, they formed societies. A society is a community of people who share a Hunter-gatherers Early people were hunter-gatherers. They hunted animals and gathered wild plants to survive. Life for these hunter-gatherers was difficult and dangerous. Still, people learned how to make tools, use fire, and even create art.

Possible answer: These sources cannot tell us what prehistoric people thought, felt, or believed. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS Cave Paintings 1. To help students apply their understanding of the language, art, and religion of prehistoric cultures, have them create cave paintings. 2. Supply students with heavy paper (e.g., paper bags or construction paper) and ask them to crumple it up so it feels rough and resembles a cave wall. (If space allows, you could attach a large piece of butcher paper to a wall or bulletin board and give each student a section to complete or create a class mural.)3. Have students create cave paintings using crayons, markers, chalk, paint, or other available art supplies. Ask students to tell the story of a \u201cday in the life\u201d of a prehistoric person. You may dim the lights and have the students work by flashlight to recreate the conditions of a cave. 4. When the artwork is complete, have students share their cave paintings with a partner or small group. Have them describe what they have created and what purpose they imagine their cave painting would serve if they lived in prehistoric times. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 3: Artwork ONLINE DOCUMENT-BASED INVESTIGATION Lascaux Cave Painting In 1940, four teenagers discovered cave paintings in Montignac, France, that are around 15,000 - 17,000 years old. Students examine the image and caption and answer the associated question. Analyze Sources What do you think the relationship might be between painting animals on cave walls and hunting? Possible answer: Early humans might have used the paintings to show others which animals they could hunt. In print edition, see image and caption. common culture. These societies developed cultures with languages, reli- gions, and art. The early humans of the Stone Age were hunter-gatherers \u2014people who hunt animals and gather wild plants, seeds, fruits, and nuts to survive. Anthropologists believe they lived in small groups. In bad weather, they might have taken shelter in a cave if there were one nearby. When food or water became hard to find, groups of people would have to move to new areas. Each person in a hunter-gatherer society did tasks to help meet the needs of the community. Anthropologists believe that most Stone Age hunters were men and that women gathered plants to eat. Women likely stayed near camps and took care of children. The first pets may also have appeared at this time. People kept dogs to help them hunt and for protection. Language, Art, and Religion The most important development of early Stone Age culture was language. Scientists have many theories about why language first developed. Some think it was to make hunting in groups easier. Others think it developed as a way for people to form relationships. Still others think language made it easier for people to resolve issues like how to distribute food. Language wasn\u2019t the only way early people expressed themselves. They also created art. People carved figures out of stone, ivory, and bone. They carved beads for personal ornamentation. They painted and carved images of people and animals on cave walls. Scientists still aren\u2019t sure why people made art. Perhaps the cave paintings were used to teach people how to hunt, or maybe they had religious meanings. Scholars know little about the religious beliefs of early people. Archaeologists have found graves th at included food and artifacts. Many scientists think these discoveries ar e proof that the first human religions developed during the Stone Age. Thousands of years ago, early people decorated cave walls with paintings, like this one in France. No one knows for sure why people created cave paintings, but many historians think they were related to hunting.Academic Vocabulary distribute to divide among a group of people Reading Check Make Inferences What information about early humans might be missing from prehistoric sources?

Have students work individually to conduct research to learn about these theories. Remind them to make certain they use only reliable sources. 3. Have students write a report discussing what they learn. In the report, they should explain several different theories. They also should identify which ideas are based on facts and which ideas are based on researcher\u2019s opinions.4. Instruct students to carefully proofread their reports, correcting any grammar or spelling errors. You may want to have students trade papers with a partner for proofreading. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 1: Acquiring Information; 16: Judging Information; and 42: Writing to InformTeach the Main Idea Early humans moved out of Africa and migrated all over the world. Draw Conclusions How did the ice ages make it easier for Stone Age people to migrate from Asia to North America? During the ice ages, large sheets of ice formed, causing ocean levels to drop. Scientists think this resulted in a land bridge between Asia and North America being exposed. Analyze Visuals According to the Early Human Migration map, when did people reach western Australia? 40,000 years ago Making Inferences Why do you think humans migrated to southern Asia earlier than to northern Europe? Possible answer: They may have been moving to areas with more pleasant climates.

People Move Out of Africa During the Old Stone Age, climate patterns around the world changed, transforming Earth\u2019s geography. In response to these changes, people began to migrate, or move, to new places. The Ice Ages Most scientists believe that about 1.6 million years ago, many places around the world began to experience long periods of freezing weather. These freezing times are called the ice ages. The ice ages ended about ten thousand years ago. During the ice ages, huge sheets of ice covered much of Earth\u2019s land. These ice sheets were formed from ocean water, leaving ocean levels lower than they are now. Many areas that are now underwater were dry land then. For example, a narrow body of water now separates Asia and North America. But scientists think that during the ice ages, the ocean level dropped and exposed a land bridge, a strip of land connecting two conti- nents. Land bridges allowed Stone Age people to migrate around the world. Settling New Lands Scientists agree that migration around the world took hundreds of thousands of years. Early hominids migrated from Africa to Asia as early as 2 million years ago. Some early hominids reached Europe around 730,000 BC, and some also spread to Southeast Asia. Interpret Maps Movement According to the map, when did people reach Europe?Migrating into Asia, early humans fanned out across the continent. Early humans migrated out of southwest Asia into Europe. By 12,000 years ago, humans had reached the Americas. Early humans first left East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Early Human Migration 367 Europe before the 1700s Europe before the 1700s 367 Teach the Main Idea People adapted to new environments by making clothing and new types of tools. Identify What are some ways that fire helped early people? It offered warmth, protection from wild animals, and a way to cook food. Compare and Contrast How were tools of the Mesolithic Era similar to those of the Paleolithic Era? How were they different? Both were primarily made of stone, however Mesolithic tools were smaller and more complex. For example, people made fish hooks out of bone. Make Decisions What kinds of shelter might be available to someone living in the Middle Stone Age? How might they decide on a type? Available shelters might include caves, pit houses, tents, and permanent structures made of wood, stone, or clay. The decision would partly depend on available materials\u2014for example, caves and wood might not always be available. Tents were more suitable for nomads than permanent structures and could be made of animal skins. Some shelters, such as stone buildings, provided more protection from the elements, wild animals, etc. More About . . . Connect to Today While the enormous land animals we call mammoths changed over time, they existed for over a million years. The mammoths gradually moved north as the climate warmed, until finally there was only a small group of about 300 surviving on an arctic island. This group died off only about 4,000 years ago. Researchers compared their DNA to larger, older groups of mammoths. They have discovered that the arctic island group may have become extinct because the gene pool was too inbred. The animals may have lost their sense of smell and stopped growing their thick, rough coats. The researchers think this information may help us to keep endangered species from becoming extinct. Conservationists working to keep these species healthy must make certain the gene pool remains diverse. For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. READING CHECK Make Inferences Why do you think it took humans hundreds of thousands of years to migrate around the world? Possible answer: Geographic features made migrating to new places difficult. Some places could not be reached until land bridges appeared. ONLINE INTERACTIVE GAME The Life of Early Humans Have students play the game to test their knowledge of facts about early humans. ONLINE INTERACTIVE VISUALS Image with Hotspots: A Mammoth House Have students explore the image of the house being built with mammoth fur and bones by using the interactive hotspots. You may wish to use the associated question as a discussion prompt. Analyze Visuals Why do you think early people used mammoth bones to build their shelters? Possible answer: Mammoths had large bones, which were good for building shelters. Later, humans also began to migrate around the world, and earlier hominids died out. Look at the map to see the dates and routes of early human migration. Humans began to migrate from East Africa to southern Africa and southwestern Asia around 100,000 years ago. After they migrated out of Africa, people moved east across southern Asia. From southwestern Asia, humans also migrated north into Europe. By 35,000 BC, humans lived across Europe. Geographic features such as high mountains and cold temperatures delayed migration northward into northern Asia. Eventu- ally, however, people from both Europe and southern Asia moved into that region. From northern Asia, people moved into North America. Once in North America, these people moved south, following herds of animals and set- tling in South America. By 9000 BC, humans lived on all continents of the world except Antarctica. People Adapt to New Environments As early people moved to new lands, they found environments that dif- fered greatly from those in East Africa. Many places were much colder and had new plants and animals. Early people had to learn to adapt to these different environments. Clothing and Shelter Although fire helped keep people warm in very cold areas, people needed more protection. To keep warm, they learned to sew animal skins together to make clothing. In Georgia, for example, archaeo l- ogists discovered flax fibers that humans used to sew clothing more than 34,000 years ago. In addition to clothing, people needed shelter to survive. Some took shelter in caves. Another early type of human-made shelter was the pit house. They were pits in the ground with roofs of branches and leaves. Early people encountered new environments and colder climates as they migrated away from East Africa.Reading Check Make Inferences Why do you think it took humans hundreds of thousands of years to migrate around the world? Module 12368 368 Module 12, Lesson 1 Teach the Main Idea The first farmers learned to grow plants and raise animals in the New Stone Age. Explain What was revolutionary about the Neolithic Revolution? People were no longer dependent on locating wild plants for food but now could grow their own. This allowed them to settle in one spot. In addition, they could control the quality of the food by choosing which seeds to plant. Identify What major event occurred during the Neolithic Era that made it easier for people to use fire? People learned how to start a fire; before, they could only use fire that had started from natural causes such as lightning. Analyze Why might a group of hunter-gatherers decide to domesticate animals? Possible answers: Animals such as wolves can provide companionship; it may be easier to raise an animal for slaughter than to kill a wild animal; because they had no refrigeration, domesticated animals could be slaughtered immediately before they were needed for food; wool and hides could be used for clothing and shelter; domesticated animals could be used for hauling heavy items. Make Predictions If you were growing a grain plant, how would you choose which seeds to save for the next growing season? Possible answer: those seeds from healthy, sturdy plants that produced large grain heads READING CHECK Find Main Ideas What were two ways people adapted to new environments?

Reading Check Find Main Ideas What were two ways people adapted to new environments? Reading Check Analyze Effects What was one effect of domestication?Academic Vocabulary development growthSome early people lived in tents made of animal skins. Others built more permanent structures of wood, stone, clay, or other materials. Even bones from large animals such as mammoths were used in building shelters. New Tools and Technologies People also adapted to new environments with new types of tools. These tools were smaller and more complex than tools from the Old Stone Age. They defined the Mesolithic (me-zuh- LI- thik) Era, or the Middle Stone Age. This period began more than ten thou- sand years ago and lasted to about five thousand years ago in some places. During this time period, people found new uses for bone and stone tools. People who lived near water invented hooks and fishing spears. Other groups invented the bow and arrow. In addition to tools, people developed new technologies to improve their lives. For example, some learned to make canoes by hollowing out logs. They used the canoes to travel on rivers and lakes. People also began to make pottery. Developments like these, in addition to clothing and shelter , allowed people to adapt to new environments. The First Farmers After the Middle Stone Age came a period of time that scientists call the Neolithic (nee-uh- LI-thik) Era, or New Stone Age. It began as early as ten thousand years ago in Southwest Asia and reached parts of Europe as early as 7000 BC. During the New Stone Age, people learned to polish stones to make tools like saws and drills. People also learned how to make fire. Before, they could only use fire that had been started by natural causes such as lightning. But tools and fire weren\u2019t the only major changes that occurred during the Neolithic Era. In fact, the biggest changes came in how people produced food. Plants and Animals After a warming trend brought an end to the ice ages, new plants began to grow in some areas. For example, wild barley and wheat plants started to spread throughout Southwest Asia. Over time , people came to depend on these wild plants for food. They began to settle where grains grew. People soon learned that they could plant seeds themselves to grow their own crops. Historians call the shift from food gathering to food pro- ducing the Neolithic Revolution. Most experts believe that this revolut ion, or change, first occurred in the societies of Southwest Asia. Eventually, people learned to change plants to make them more use- ful. They planted only the largest grains or the sweetest fruits. They found new ways to use animals. They kept sheep or goats for milk, food, and wool. They used larger animals to carry or pull heavy loads or tools. The process of changing plants or animals to make them more useful to humans is called domestication. The domestication of plants and animals led to the development of agriculture, or farming. For the first time, people could produce their own food. This development changed human society forever. 369 Europe before the 1700s Europe before the 1700s 369 Teach the Main Idea Farming changed societies and the way people lived. Explain How did agriculture lead to trade? People began to produce more food than they needed to survive, so they were able to trade that food for other goods. Draw Conclusions How have archeologists been able to determine that Neolithic societies began dividing people into classes? They have found luxury goods in some graves, indicating that these people were wealthier and had higher social positions than others. Recall What are megaliths and what is an example? Megaliths are huge stones used as monuments or sites for religious ceremonies. Stonehenge is an example. More About . . . The Plastered Skulls of Jericho In the 1950s archeologists uncovered some skulls in the ancient city of Jericho. However, these were very unusual skulls. They had been painted, plaster had been added to create faces, and shells were placed in the eyes. These skulls were from around 7000 to 6000 BC. More extensive religious traditions began developing during this time period as people settled in communities and cultivated crops. Some experts think the plastered skulls were a way of worshiping dead ancestors. Other scholars believe they may have been used to help people mourn their dead relatives. DRAW CONCLUSIONS Debating the Purpose of Stonehenge 1. Have students work in pairs to learn about the theories concerning why Stonehenge was built. Remind students to use reliable sources in their research. 2. Instruct students to create a chart listing these theories and the reasons for and against each one.3. Have students prepare a debate. Each student should choose one theory and present reasons he or she thinks it is correct. They also should present reasons they think their partner\u2019s theory is incorrect. 4. Have students present their debates to the class. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 10: Debates; and 30: Research Farming Changes Societies The Neolithic Revolution brought huge changes to people\u2019s lives. With survival more certain, people could focus on activities other than findin g food. Domestication of plants and animals enabled people to use plant fibers to make cloth. The domestication of animals made it possible to use wool from goats and sheep and skins from horses for clothes. People also began to build permanent settlements. As they started raising crops and animals, they needed to stay in one place instead of con- tinuing to travel on nomadic journeys to other areas of the world. Then, once people were able to control their own food production, the world\u2019s population grew. In some areas, farming communities developed into towns. Early Economies In Neolithic communities, people used primitive tools and methods to grow, harvest, and hunt sources of food. They created large pits for storage of food. This meant that farmers could increase their productivity by harvesting large amounts of food and storing it after harvest. Having a surplus, or an extra amount, made trade possible, since farmers had a supply of food that others might want to purchase or gain through barter. A barter system is a form of exchange where goods and services are traded for other goods and services. Social Order Farming and trade led to the growth of wealth in Neolithic communities. As Neolithic societies grew wealthy, they started to divi de people into classes, or social groups based on wealth. Remains of societ- ies can sometimes give clues about these social structures. In Europe, for example, archaeologists have found luxury goods such as jewelry in the graves of women. This evidence might show that women had high posi- tions in some early European societies. They also found weapons in graves, which might mean that warriors became important to early European societies. Early farmers harvest and process the food they grew while domesticated sheep and goats graze. 370 Module 12 370 Module 12, Lesson 1 ONLINE ANALYZE VIDEOS Stonehenge Have students watch the video individually or as a class to learn about a new discovery at Stonehenge.

Scholars think Neolithic humans may have constructed Stonehenge as a burial site, a site for religious ceremonies, or as an astronomical observatory. Cause EffectsDevelopment of agricultureReligious Practices As populations of towns grew, groups of people gathered to perform religious ceremonies. Some put up megaliths. Megaliths are huge stones used as monuments or as the sites for religious gatherings. Early people probably believed in gods and goddesses associated with the four elements\u2014air, water, fire, and earth\u2014or with animals. For example, one early European group honored a thunder god, while another group worshiped bulls. Some scholars also believe that many prehistori c people prayed to their ancestors. People in some societies today still hold many of these same beliefs. Summary and Preview Stone Age people adapted to new environments by domesticating plants and animals.

What important advancement did early humans make during the Paleolithic Era? They started making fire to cook food. They started making and using stone tools. They started using nets to catch food. They started growing crops and raising animals. Alternate Question How did early humans use tools during the Paleolithic Era? Select the two correct answers. to dig canals to grow crops to cut animal hides to shape clay bricks to hunt larger animals 2. How did the ice ages allow early humans to migrate to different parts of the world? Ocean levels rose and land bridges disappeared. Warmer weather caused humans to migrate to colder climates. Ocean levels dropped and land bridges emerged. Colder weather caused humans to migrate to warmer climates. Alternate Question Drag the events into chronological order from top to bottom. Temperatures fall worldwide. Ice sheets form from ocean water. Areas formerly underwater become dry land. People travel across land bridges. 3. Which of the following was an advancement made during the Mesolithic Era? making fire to cook food using larger tools such as sharp rocks using smaller tools such as fishing hooks making canoes to trade between continents Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. During the Mesolithic Era people invented smaller, more complex tools and developed new technology. 4. Which of the following is an example of domestication during the Neolithic Revolution? keeping sheep for food and wool hunting mammoths for food and shelter gathering wild plants, fruits, and nuts for food using animal skins and plant fibers for clothing Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. During the Neolithic Revolution, people started producing food for the first time.5. How did increased productivity during the Neolithic Era lead to early economies? People were able to grow enough food to feed their families. People could use surplus food as part of religious ceremonies. People were able to grow food for the benefit of their leaders. People could barter surplus food for other goods and services. Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. During the Neolithic Era, people with surplus food were able to barter with other people for other goods. 6. Make Inferences Why do you think early humans of the Paleolithic Era lived in small groups? Living in small groups would have made it easier for early humans to survive during the Paleolithic Era. Different jobs could be divided among the members of the society to ensure the group found food and took care of its children. 7. Summarize Where did the human migration to populate the six livable continents start from nearly 100,000 years ago and where did it end by 9000 BC? Human migration started in East Africa. It ended when humans reached South America. 8. Elaborate How did early people make clothing and shelters to adapt to new environments during the Mesolithic Era? Early people moving into colder environments learned to make clothing by sewing animal skins together. They also made shelters by digging pit houses or building structures out of wood, stone, clay, or even mammoth bones. 9. Make Judgments Why do you think making fire was such an important advancement during the Neolithic Era? Before people learned how to make fire, they had to rely on lightning to create fire. After people learned to make fire, they could use it to cook food, stay warm, and provide light. 10. Draw Conclusions How do archaeologists know that Neolithic societies divided people into social groups based on wealth? When archaeologists investigated the graves of people who lived in Neolithic societies, they found people buried with jewelry. From this evidence archeologists can conclude that people buried with luxury goods held a high position in society. 371a Module 12, Lesson 1 ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS continued from page 363 More About . . . Chauvet Cave In 1994, three explorers in southern France discovered an amazing trove of ancient artwork. Known as Chauvet Cave, it is one of the most famous examples of prehistoric artwork, with a variety of drawings including at least 13 different animal species. These animals include mammoths, lions, horses, and cave bears. Paleolithic artists created the drawings around 30,000 years ago. Some drawings are etched, or incised, around their edges, giving them a three-dimensional appearance. Access to the cave is strictly limited because experts are concerned that the drawings could be damaged by large numbers of visitors. However, no one knows how many other similar caves might be waiting to be discovered. continued from page 364 STRUGGLING READERS Lesson Preview 1.

Beringia During the Pleistocene Ice Age, which ended about 12,000 years ago, huge glaciers covered much of Europe, North America, and Asia. This caused the level of the oceans to drop as much as 300 feet (91.4 m), resulting in a land bridge between Asia and North America. This land bridge, known as Beringia, was where the Bering Sea is today. Because of the land bridge, many plants and animals were able to spread between Asia and North America. These included horses, mastodons, and woolly mammoths. Scientists think that people might have crossed the bridge while they were pursuing the animals for food.continued from page 368 SOLVE PROBLEMS Moving to a New Location Tell students that they live in the Middle Stone Age.

Have the class work together to come up with a list of questions and possible answers. Questions might include: \u2022What materials might you use to build your new home? \u2022How could you protect your home from wild animals? \u2022How would you get water from the river to your new location? *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 14: Group Activity; and 35: Solving Problems More About . . . Skara Brae In the 1850s a severe storm hit the islands off the northeast coast of Scotland, uncovering a Neolithic village known as Skara Brae. The village is amazingly well preserved and probably was home to about 100 people. Because no wood was available locally, buildings were made of stone. Each home had an identical layout, and furniture, such as beds and storage, was also built of stone. The people were farmers growing barley and raising sheep and cattle. Fish and venison were also a part of their diet. Because most Neolithic villages were made of wood, little remains of them today. The survival of Skara Brae is evidence of the ability of its people to adapt to their environment.

If YOU lived there . . . You live in the ancient city of Athens, one of the largest cities in Greece. Your brother, just two years older than you, is excited. He is finally old enough to take part in the city\u2019s government. He and your father, along with the other free men in the city, will meet to vote on the city\u2019s laws and leaders. Your mother and your sisters, however, cannot take part in the process. Why is your brother excited about voting? Early Greek Culture Suppose you and some friends wanted to go to the movies, but you could not decide which movie to see. Some of you might want to see the latest action thriller, while others are more in the mood for a comedy. How could you decide which movie you would go to see? One way to decide would be to take a vote. Whichever movie got more votes would be the one you saw. Did you know that by voting you would be taking part in a process invented some 2,500 years ago? It is true. One of the earliest peoples to use voting to make major decisions was the ancient Greeks. Voting was only one of the many contributions the Greeks made to our culture, though. In fact, many people call ancient Greece the birthplace of modern civilization. City-States Early Greece could be a dangerous place. Waves of invaders swept through the land, and violence was common. Eventually, people began to band together in groups for protec- tion. Over time, these groups developed into city-states, or political units made up of a city and all the surrounding lands. In the center of most city-states was a fortress on a hill. This hill was called the acropolis (uh-KRAH-puh-luhs), which is Greek for \u201chighest city.\u201d In addition to the fortress, many city- states built temples and other public buildings on the acropolis. Around the acropolis was the rest of the city, including houses and markets. High walls usually surrounded the city for protection. In wartime, farmers who lived outside the walls could seek safety inside.Lesson 2 Ancient Greece The Big Idea Greek culture spread in Europe and Asia through colonization, trade, and conquest.

Movement Why do you think Greek trade routes usually followed coastlines?Greek City-States and Colonies, c. 600 BC Life in the city often focused on the marketplace, or agora (A-guh-ruh) in Greek. Farmers brought their crops to the market to trade for goods made by craftspeople in the town. Because it was a large open space, the market also served as a meeting place. People held both political and reli- gious assemblies in the market. It often contained shops as well. The city-state became the foundation of Greek civilization. In additio n to providing its people with security and a marketplace, the city-state gav e people a new sense of identity. People thought of themselves as residents of a particular city-state, not as Greeks. Colonies In time, some Greeks became curious about neighboring lands around the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Some city-states establishe d new outposts, or colonies, around these seas. You can see these colonies on the map. Some of them still exist today as modern cities, such as Naples, Italy, and Marseille, France. Although they were independent, most colonies kept ties with the older cities of Greece. They traded goods and shared ideas. These ties helped strengthen the economies of both cities and colonies, and they kept Greek culture strong. Because they stayed in contact, Greek cities all over Eur ope shared a common culture.Reading Check Summarize Where did the ancient Greeks establish colonies? 373 Europe before the 1700s Europe before the 1700s 373 ONLINE ANALYZE VIDEOS Battle of Marathon Have students watch the video individually or as a class to learn how the Greeks defeated the Persians at Marathon.

Possible answer: The Greeks stretched out their attack line and circled the Persians. The Persians were surrounded and could not break through the Greeks\u2019 line; the Greeks had better weapons and armor.Teach the Main Idea The golden age of Greece saw advances in government, art, and philosophy. Recall Why did the Greek city-states band together around 500 BC? to defend themselves against the invading Persians Identify Cause and Effect In what way did the armed struggle between the Greeks and the Persians make the golden age possible? The Greeks were able to defeat the Persians, thus gaining confidence and the realization that they were capable of great achievements.

Connect to Math and Science: More than Pi Greek scientists and mathematicians made many advances during and after the golden age. Euclid published theories that became the foundation of modern geometry, and Archimedes calculated the value of pi. Greek geographers correctly calculated the circumference of Earth. They also knew that Earth rotated on its axis and revolved around the sun. (This knowledge would not be widely accepted for nearly 2,000 years.) Other scientists invented machines operated by air, water pressure, and steam. However, the technology did not yet exist to build many of them. Medical scientists also made many discoveries based on their studies of the human body. The Hippocratic oath, describing the Greeks\u2019 notion of ethical medical behavior, is still sworn by doctors today. For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. COLLABORATIVE LEARNING Daily Life in Athens 1. Organize students into small groups. Assign each group one aspect of daily life\u2014the role of women and children, education, work, religion, government, recreation, and so on. 2. Have each group research its topic and develop a summary of what they have learned. 3. Have each group present the information they have learned to the class. Suggest that they use visuals, including diagrams and photographs, in their presentations.4. Lead a discussion comparing aspects of daily life in Athens to the same aspects of daily life today. Encourage students to express opinions about which culture seems more attractive in terms of daily life. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 14: Group Activity; 24: Oral Presentations; and 30: Research The Golden Age of Greece When most people think of ancient Greek culture today, certain images come to mind. They think of the ruins of stately temples and of realis- tic statues. They also think of great writers, philosophers, and scienti sts whose ideas changed the world. These images represent some of the many contributions the Greeks made to world history. Remarkably, most of these contributions were developed during a relatively short time, between 500 and 300 BC. For that reason, this period is often called a golden age, a period in a society\u2019s history marked by great achievements. The Growth of Greek Power Early in Greece\u2019s history, city-states remained fiercely independent. Each city-state focused on its own con- cerns and did not interfere in the others\u2019 affairs. Around 500 BC, however, an invading army caused the Greeks to band together against a common enemy. That invasion came from Persia, a powerful empire in central Asia. The Persian army was huge, well trained, and experienced. Greece, on the other hand, had no single army. Each city-state had an army, but none was as large as Persia\u2019s. As a result, the Persians expected a quick victory. Nevertheless, the Greeks took up arms against the Persians. Led by Athens, a city-state in eastern Greece, the Greeks were able to defeat the Persians and keep Greece from being conquered. When the Persians invaded again ten years later, the Athenians once again helped defeat them. The victory over the Persians increased the confidence of people all over Greece. They realized that they were capable of great achievements. In the period after the Persian invasion, the people of Greece made amazing advances in art, writing, and thinking. Many of these advances were made by the people of Athens.The agora of Athens was located below the Acropolis. It was the center of commercial and political life. Module 12374 374 Module 12, Lesson 2 ADVANCED/GIFTED Should I Stay or Should I Go? 1. Ask students to imagine that they live in a Greek city-state, but have to move to a new colony.

Athenian Culture In the century after the defeat of Persia, Athens was the cultural center of Greece. Some of history\u2019s most famous politicians , artists, and thinkers lived in Athens during this time. One reason for the great advances the Athenians made during this time was their city\u2019s leadership. Leaders such as Pericles (PER-uh-kleez ), who ruled Athens in the 400s BC, supported the arts and encouraged the creation of great works. Athens became prosperous, or successful and wealthy, under Pericles\u2019s leadership. Because of this wealth, Pericles was able to hire great archit ects and artists to construct and decorate the Parthenon, ancient Greece\u2019s m ost famous temple. Athenian Democracy Leaders like Pericles had great power in Athens, but they did not rule alone. The city of Athens was a democracy, and its leaders Pericles (c. 495\u2013429 BC) Pericles, the most famous leader in all of Athenian history, wanted the city\u2019s people to be proud of their city. In his speeches, he emphasized the greatness of Athenian democracy and encouraged everyone to take part. He also worked to make the city beautiful. He hired the city\u2019s best architects to build monuments, such as the Parthenon, and hired great artists to decorate them. He also supported the work of writers and poets in order to make Athens the cultural center of all Greece.BIOGRAPHY Athens was governed as a democracy. Once a month, all adult men in the city gathered together in an assembly to make the city\u2019s laws. Men spoke in the assembly to support or argue against ideas. Sometimes, people in the crowd argued with them. Voting was done either by show of hands or by secret ballot. The ballots used were broken pieces of pottery.Athenian Democracy 375 Europe before the 1700s Europe before the 1700s 375 SUMMARIZE Parthenon Restoration Project 1.

The Parthenon was a great architectural achievement; it is the temple of Athena, after whom Athens was named. In print edition, see image of same title. Once a year, the people of Athens held a great festival in honor of Athena. Part of the festival included a great procession that wound through the city. were elected. In fact, Athens was the world\u2019s first democracy. No one else in history had created a government in which people ruled themselves. In Athens, most power was in the hands of the people. All the city\u2019s leaders could do was suggest ideas. Those ideas had to be approved by an assembly made up of the city\u2019s free men before they were enacted. As a result, it was vital that all the men of Athens took part in making government decisions.The Parthenon The Parthenon is often seen as a symbol of ancient Athens. It was a temple to the goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their protector. The temple is now in ruins, but this illustration shows how it may have looked when it was built around 440 BC. Analyze Visuals Why do you think people consider the Parthenon to be a symbol of ancient Athens?Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon had huge marble columns to support its roof.The Parthenon was decorated with carvings of events from Greek history and mythology. Inside the Parthenon was a magnificent statue of Athena by the sculptor Phidias. Many people consider him the greatest sculptor in all of Greece.

DRAW CONCLUSIONS Debating Progress vs. Preservation 1. Tell students that air pollution is a serious problem in Athens today, damaging the marble of the Parthenon and other monuments. 2. Have students search the Internet or library to learn more about the sources and effects of the pollution. Ask them to also research what is being done to prevent the damage. 3. Assign groups different sides in a debate. Tell them that there is only enough money to either repair the monuments (preservation) or finish new projects in Athens (progress). Have each group gather reasons to support its position.4. Have students debate the issue. Afterward, have them explain whether or not they were persuaded by the other side\u2019s arguments, and why. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 10: Debates; and 30: Research The people of Athens were very proud of their democ racy and also of their city in general. This pride was reflected in their city\u2019s buildings and art. Look at the picture of the Parthenon again. Why do you think the tem- ple was so large and so elaborately decorated? Like many Greek buildings, it was designed to be a symbol of the city. It was supposed to make people see Athens as a great and glorious city. Architecture and Art The Parthenon may be the most famous building from ancient Greece, but it is only one of many magnificent structures built by the Greeks. All over Greece, builders created beautiful marble temples. These temples were symbols of the glory of the cities in which they were built. Greek temples and other buildings were often decora ted with statues and carvings. These works by Greek artists are still ad mired by people today. Greek art is so admired because of the skill and careful preparation of ancient Greek artists. These artists wanted their works to look realisti c. To achieve their goals, they watched people as they stood and moved. They wanted to learn exactly what the human body looked like while it was in motion. The artists then used what they learned from their observations to make their statues as lifelike as possible. Science, Philosophy, and Literature Artists were not the only people in ancient Greece to study other people. Scientists, for example, studie d people to learn how the body worked. Through these studies, the Greeks learned a great deal about medicine and biology. Other Greek scholars made great advances in math, astronomy, and other areas of science. Greek philosophers, or thinkers, also studied peopl e. They wanted to fig- ure out how people could be happy. Three of the wor ld\u2019s most influential phi- losophers\u2014Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle\u2014lived and taught in Athens during this time. Their ideas continue to shape how we liv e and think even today. The ancient Greeks were master artists. Their paintings and statues have been admired for hundreds of years. Greek statues are so admired because the sculptors who made them tried to make them look perfect. They took great care to make their art lifelike. Because of this, artists from later civilizations admired and imitated the works of Greek artists. This Roman sculpture is of Pallas, the Roman equivalent of the goddess Athena. It is similar to a sculpture of Athena by the Greek artist Phidias that once stood in the Acropolis. Analyze Visuals What details make this statue lifelike?

By heaven! when she vomited, all the sea was like a cauldron seething over intense fire, when the mixture suddenly heaves and rises. The shot spume [foam] soared to the landside heights, and fell like rain. But when she swallowed the sea water down we saw the funnel of the maelstrom [whirlpool], heard the rock bellowing all around, and dark sand raged on the bottom far below. My men all blanched [grew pale] against the gloom, our eyes were fixed upon that yawning mouth in fear of being devoured. \u2014Homer from the Odyssey , translated by Robert FitzgeraldThe ancient Greeks also made huge contributions to world literature. Some of the world\u2019s timeless classics were written in ancient Greece. They include stories of Greek heroes and their daring adventures, poems about love and friendship, and myths meant to teach lessons about life. Among the earliest Greek writings are two great epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey , by a poet named Homer. Like most epics, both poems describe the deeds of great heroes. The heroes in Homer\u2019s poems fought in the Trojan War. In this war, the Mycenaean Greeks fought the Trojans, people of the city called Troy. Chances are that you have read a book, seen a film, or watched a play inspired by\u2014or even written by\u2014the ancient Greeks. Actually, if you hav e ever seen a play at all, then you have the Greeks to thank. The ancient Greeks were the first people to write and perform drama, or plays. Once a part of certain religious ceremonies, plays became one of the most popular forms of entertainment in Greece. The Decline of the City-States As great as it was, the Greek golden age could not last forever. In the end, Greece was torn apart by a war between Athens and its rival city-state, Sparta. The Odyssey takes place after the Trojan War has ended. It describes the adventures of another hero, Odysseus, as he makes his way home to his kingdom of Ithaca. His voyage is full of obstacles\u2014including the two sea monsters described in this passage. The idea for these monsters probably came from an actual strait in the Mediterranean Sea, where a jagged cliff rose on one side and dangerous whirlpools churned on the other.

Jealous of the influence Athens had over other city-states, the Spartans attacked Athens. The war between these two powerful city-states devastated Greece. Othe r city-states joined the war, supporting one side or the other. For years, the war went on. In the end, Sparta won, but Greece was in shambles. Thousands of people had been killed, and whole cities had been destroyed. Weakened, Greece lay open for a foreign conqueror to swoop in and take over. The Empire of Alexander In fact, a conqueror did take over all of Greece in the 330s BC. For the first time in its history, all of Greece was unified under a single ruler. He was from an area called Macedonia just north of Greece, an area that many Greeks considered uncivilized. He was known as Alexander the Great. Alexander\u2019s Conquests Alexander swept into Greece with a strong, well- trained army in 336 BC. In just a few years, he had conquered all of Greece.

Students should list the major events on the timeline, such as the establishment of city-states and colonies, Athens\u2019s defeat of the Persians, the golden age, war with Sparta, and Alexander\u2019s conquest of Greece. As Greek people moved to these cities, however, they mingled with the people and cultures in the area. As a result, Greek culture blended with other cultures. The result was a new type of culture that mixed elements from many people and places. Because the Greek word for Greek is \u201cHellenic,\u201d historians often refer to these blended cultures as Hellenistic, or Greek-like. Hellenistic culture helped shape life in Egypt, central Asia, and other parts of the world for many years. Summary and Preview Greece was the location of the first great civiliza- tion in Europe.
