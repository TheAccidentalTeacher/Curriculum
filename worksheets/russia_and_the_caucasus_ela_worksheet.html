        Lesson 1 Big Idea Russia is big and cold with vast plains and forests, while the Caucasus features rugged mountains with seas to the east and west. Main Ideas •The physical features of Russia and the Caucasus include plains, mountains, and rivers. •Russia’s cold climate contrasts sharply with the warmer Caucasus. •Russia has a wealth of natural resources, but many are hard to access.Lesson 2 Big Idea Strict rule, unrest, and ethnic diversity have shaped Russia’s history and culture. Today, it faces many challenges. Main Ideas •The Russian Empire grew under powerful leaders, but unrest and war led to its end. •The Soviet Union emerged as a Communist superpower, with rigid government control. •Russia’s history and diversity have influenced its culture. •The Russian Federation is working to develop democracy and a market economy. •Russia’s physical geography, cities, and economy define its many culture regions. •Russia faces a number of serious challenges.Essential Question Preview Are the challenges faced by Russia and the Caucasus countries in establishing and maintaining their democracies greater than those faced by the United States after it won the American Revolution? Have the students consider the Essential Question and capture their initial responses. Explore the Essential Question •Discuss why Russia is divided into several cultural regions based on features, such as population, natural resources, and economic activity. •Ask students what they know about the Caucasus countries. Tell them that political and cultural differences in the region sometimes lead to violence and war. Encourage students to keep the Essential Question in mind as they work through the module. Help students plan inquiries and develop their own supporting questions such as: In what ways are Russia and the Caucasus strengthened by the region’s cultural and ethnic diversity? In what ways does this diversity lead to difficulties? Why might it be difficult for people without a history of democratic government to learn how democracy works? You may want to assign students to write a short essay in response to the Essential Question when they complete the module. Encourage student to use their notes and responses to inform their essays. Explore the Online Video ANALYZE VIDEOS The Romanovs Invite students to watch the video to learn about t he mystery that once surrounded Russia’s last royal fa mily. History Why did it take so long for the deaths of the Romanov family to come to light? possible answers: The government had tried to keep the execution secret; those who found the bodies feared the government’s reaction if they revealed what they found; once the government reopened the grave, they had to turn to foreign forensic and DNA experts. 80°E100°E120°E140°E160°E160°W 180° 60°E40°E20°E20°W 80°N80°N 40°N60°N 0° Arctic CircleARCTIC OCEAN PACIFIC OCEANNorth Sea Barents SeaBering Sea Sea of Okhotsk Sea of Japan (East Sea)Baltic Sea Black Sea Caspian SeaBering Strait Volga RiverYeniseyLena River Lena River Angara River Ob River Don RiverRiverAmur River Lake BaikalSakhalin IslandKuril Islands CAUCASUS M TS.

Geography As the world’s largest country, Russia has a variety of landforms and bodies of water. History Russia’s government has changed drastically over time from a monarchy to a communist dictatorship to a democracy. Culture Swan Lake was composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaicovsky, a famous Russian composer. Analyze Visuals Have students examine the map and images and answer the following questions: 1. What can you tell about Russia and the region by looking at the political map? The locations and size of the countries; Russia dominates the region; the locations of rivers and other bodies of water; the locations of capital and major cities; Moscow is a long distance from much of Russia. 2. Based on the picture of the Kremlin and surrounding buildings, what is Russia’s most characteristic architectural feature? onion-domed churches Online Module Flip Cards Use the flip cards as a whole class activity or in student pairs to preview the module’s Key Terms and Places. Students can guess the meaning of each word, then review its definition, or do the reverse, using the flip card’s toggle button to switch from “Term” to “Definition” mode. Students can also use the flip cards at the end of the module as a review tool before taking the Module Assessment. Online Map Activity Students can use this activity to review some of the locations discussed in this module. To complete, have students drag each label to the correct location on the map.Lesson 3 Big Idea In an area long ruled by outside groups, the Caucasus republics are struggling to strengthen their economies and to deal with ethnic unrest. Main Ideas •Many groups have ruled and influenced the Caucasus during its long history. •Today, the Caucasus republics are working to improve their economies, but they struggle with ethnic unrest and conflict. Geography A volcano created Crater Bay in the Kuril Islands off the east coast of Russia. The islands have several active volcanoes.

Above, dancers perform Swan Lake . 553 Russia and the Caucasus Russia and the Caucasus 553 Reading Social Studies READING FOCUS Use Context Clues Organize the class into pairs. Then have each pair go through one of their textbooks. Ask students to look for sentences in which a word is explained in the context. Ask students to find five sentences that use vocabulary clues to define a term. Then have students make a list of the different ways the meaning of a word is given in the context of the text. Answers might include clue words or punctuation. YOU TRY IT! gulag: harsh Soviet labor camps often located in Siberia; ethnic cleansing: an attempt to remove an ethnic group YOU TRY IT! Read the following sentences, and identify the restatement for each underlined term.Use Context Clues READING FOCUS One way to figure out the meaning of an unfamiliar word or phrase is by finding clues in its context, the words or sentences surrounding it. A common context clue is a restatement. Restatements simply define the new word using ordinary words you already know. Notice how the following passage uses a restatement to define Bolsheviks .Reading Social Studies Later that year the Bolsheviks , a radical Russian Communist group, seized power in the Russian Revolution. They then killed the czar and his family. In 1922 the Bolsheviks formed a new country, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), or the Soviet Union. Restatement: a radical Russian Communist group Stalin had anyone who spoke out against the govern- ment jailed, exiled, or killed. Millions of people were sent to gulags , harsh Soviet labor camps often located in Siberia. During World War I (1914–1918), the Turks forced all Armenians to leave. Hundreds of thousands of Arme- nians died during this ethnic cleansing , or attempt to remove an ethnic group. As you read this module, look for context clues that restate the meanings of words you may not have encountered before. 554 Module 17 554 Module 17 LESSON 1 Woolly Mammoths in Siberia The Volga Boatmen Key Terms Review Reading Check Graphic Organizer Activity Lesson AssessmentDocument-Based Investigation: Russia: PhysicalMap: The Caucasus: Climate Big Idea Russia is big and cold with vast plains and forests, while the Caucasus features rugged mountains with seas to the east and west.Lesson 1 Planner Physical Geography VisualsMaps, Graphs, and ChartsVideos AssessmentSourcesExtend and Enrich Russia and the Caucasus 554a The Volga Boatmen Article Students read about the history of the Volga boatmen and then consider other strenuous occupations.

Students will explore the interactive map to discover characteristics of the region.Teach the Big Idea 1. Whole Class Open/Introduction If YOU lived there . . . What scenes might you include in your film? Review the scenario with students and lead a class discussion around responses to the question. Remind students that all responses are valid as long as they are supported with valid reasoning. You may wish to review the following points to frame your discussion. Consider the PHYSICAL FEATURES: •marshes of the West Siberian Plain, and the Ural Mountains •Lake Baikal •volcanoes in the Russian Far East Consider the CLIMATE AND PLANT LIFE: •snow-covered evergreen forests of the taiga •grasslands of the steppe •frozen rivers and permafrost of Siberia 2. Direct Teach Introduce the Big Idea: Russia is big and cold with vast plains and forests, while the Caucasus features rugged mountains with seas to the east and west. Ask students if they can name the world’s largest country. Many will be able to identify Russia. Then ask how big they believe Russia is compared to the United States. It is almost twice as big . Have the class speculate on ways the physical features of Russia compare with those of the United States. Write their answers on the board, and refer to them as you work through this lesson. 3. Practice/Assess/Inquire Have each student choose a term or place that they want to learn more about from the “Key Terms and Places” list. Have students use the text to describe the term or place in a complete sentence. Then have students make posters illustrating the term or place they chose, and include their sentence on the poster. 4. Explore Ask students to share their posters with the class, reading their sentence aloud. 5. Whole Group Close/Reflect Have students write a short paragraph about the physical geography of Russia or the Caucasus, generalizing based on the posters that were shared in class. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 28: Posters If YOU lived there . . . You are making a documentary about the Trans-Siberia n Railway, a famous train that crosses the vast country of Russia. The train travels more than 5,700 miles across plains and mountains and through thick forests. As the train leaves the city of Moscow, you look out the window and see wheat fields and white birch trees. What scenes might you include in your film? Physical Features Have you ever stood on two continents at once? In Russia’s Ural (YOOHR-uhl) Mountains, the continents of Europe and Asia meet. Europe lies to the west, Asia to the east. Together, Europe and Asia form the large landmass of Eurasia. On the map, you can see that a large chunk of Eurasia is the country of Russia. In fact, Russia is the world’s largest country. Compared to the United States, Russia is almost twice as big. Georgia, Armenia (ahr-MEE-nee-uh), and Azerbaijan (a-zuhr-by-JAHN) lie south of Russia in the Caucasus (KAW- kuh-suhs), the area between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This area, which includes part of southern Russia, is named for the Caucasus Mountains. Landforms Locate Russia on the physical map. As the map shows, Russia’s landforms vary from west to east. The Northern European Plain stretches across western, or European, Russia. This fertile plain forms Russia’s heartland, where most Russians live. Moscow, Russia’s capital, is located there. To the east, the plain rises to form the Ural Mountains. These low mountains are worn down Physical Geography The Big Idea Russia is big and cold with vast plains and forests, while the Caucasus features rugged mountains with seas to the east and west. Main Ideas ■The physical features of Russia and the Caucasus include plains, mountains, and rivers. ■Russia’s cold climate contrasts sharply with the warmer Caucasus. ■Russia has a wealth of natural resources, but many are hard to access.

ONLINE GRAPHIC ORGANIZER Physical Geography As students read the lesson, have them use the graphic organizer to take notes. Students can review their graphic organizer notes at the end of the lesson to answer the following question: Compare and Contrast How are Russia and the Caucasus similar? How are they different? Both have mountains, plains, and bodies of water that are commercially important. Both make money from exports. Russia is much larger than the Caucasus, however, and the Caucasus has a milder climate.

The vast area between the Urals and the Pacific Ocean is Siberia. This area includes several landforms. The West Siberian Plain lies between the Urals and the Yenisey River and between the shores of the Arctic Ocean and the foothills of the Altay Mountains. Because the plain tilts northward, its rivers flow toward th e Arctic Ocean. The West Siberian Plain is a flat, marshy area. It is one of the largest plains in the world. East of this plain lies the Central Siberian Plateau. Mountain ranges run through southern and eastern Siberia. Eastern Siberia is called the Russian Far East. This area includes the Kamchatka (kuhm-CHAHT-kuh) Peninsula and several islands. The Russian Far East is part of the Ring of Fire, the area circling the Pacific.Interpret Maps 1. Location What part of Russia is called Siberia? 2. Human-Environment Interaction In what ways might mountains affect life in eastern Russia? The Kamchatka Peninsula on Russia’s east coast has many old and active volcanoes.Russia: Physical Module 17556 556 Module 17, Lesson 1 MAKE GENERALIZATIONS The Importance of the Volga River 1. Review with students the information in the text about the Volga River. Remind students that it is the longest river in Europe. 2. Have students make a generalization about why the Volga still serves as a valuable resource today. For example, the Volga is the core of Russia’s river network.3. Have students write a short essay describing ways in which the Volga might continue to be a valuable resource in the future. For example, have students predict whether the river will continue to be used as a transportation route or if they think it might be valuable in other ways. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 12: Drawing Conclusions; and 37: Writing Assignments For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. The Ring of Fire is known for its volcanoes and ear thquakes, and the Russian Far East is no exception. The Kamchatka Pen insula alone contains 120 volcanoes, 20 of which are still active. In som e areas, steam from within Earth breaks free to form geysers and hot sp rings. The Sakhalin and Kuril islands lie south of the peninsula. Russi a seized the islands from Japan after World War II. Japan still claims owners hip of the Kuril Islands. The Caucasus countries consist largely of rugged up lands. The Caucasus Mountains cover much of Georgia and extend into Arm enia and Azerbaijan. These soaring mountains include Mount Elbrus (el-BR OOS). At 18,510 feet (5,642 m), it is the highest peak in Europe. South of the Caucasus Mountains, a plateau covers much of Armenia. Gorges cut through this plateau, and earthquakes are common there. Bodies of Water Some of the longest rivers in the world flow through the region. One of the most important is the Volga (VAHL-guh) River in western Russia. The longest river in Europe, the Volga winds southward to the Caspian Sea. The Volga has long formed the core of Russia’s river network. Canals link the Volga to the nearby Don River and to the Baltic Sea. Even longer rivers than the Volga flow through Siberia in the Asian part of Russia. The Ob (AWB), Yenisey (yi-ni-SAY), and Lena rivers flow northward to the Arctic Ocean. Like many of Russia’s rivers, they are frozen for much of the year. The ice often hinders shipping and trade and closes some of Russia’s ports for part of the year. In addition to its rivers, Russia has some 200,000 lakes. Lake Baikal (by-KAHL), in south-central Siberia, is the world’s deepest lake. Althoug h not that large in surface area, Lake Baikal is deep enough to hold all the water in all five of the Great Lakes. Because of its beauty, Lake Baikal is called the Jewel of Siberia. Logging and factories have polluted the water , but Russians are now working to clean up the lake.The snow-capped peaks of the Caucasus Mountains rise above a mountain village and the remains of a fortress built in the 900s. 557 Russia and the Caucasus Russia and the Caucasus 557 READING CHECK Summarize What are the major landforms in Russia and the Caucasus? Northern European Plain, Ural Mountains, West Siberian Plain, Kamchatka Peninsula, Caucasus MountainsTeach the Main Idea Russia’s cold climate contrasts sharply with the warmer Caucasus. Describe What is Russia’s climate like? short summers and long, snowy winters; milder west of the Urals, growing colder as one goes north and east Identify What is the taiga? a forest of mainly evergreen trees covering about half of Russia Generalize Make a generalization about Russia’s climate. Russia’s climate is generally cold and snowy. Recall Which body of water contributes to the humid subtropical climate of the Caucasus? the Mediterranean Sea Compare How is plant life in Russia similar to that in the Caucasus? Both regions have impressive forests. More About . . . CONNECT TO ECONOMICS Health Resorts in Georgia During the Soviet era, people flocked to Georgia to enjoy the clean mountain air and water at the region’s numerous health spas. The air in Abastumani, one of Georgia’s oldest health resorts, is claimed to relieve asthma and tuberculosis; the waters near Tsqaltubo in western Georgia are reputed to cure numerous ailments. Though many of Georgia’s spas have fallen into disrepair, the nation is attempting to rebuild its resort industry with the help of the World Bank and private investors from Asia and the Middle East. ADVANCED/GIFTED Research and Write a News Story 1. Have students use the Internet or the library to learn about a current event in Russia or the Caucasus region. Students should obtain information from at least three different sources.2. Based on their research, have students write their own news story to share with the class. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 42: Writing to Inform In the Caucasus, lowlands lie along the Black and Caspian seas. The Black Sea forms the region’s western border. This sea connects to the Mediterranean Sea and is important for trade. To the east, the region is bordered by the Caspian Sea, which is actually a salt-water lake that stretches for nearly 750 miles (1,207 km) from north to south. It is the largest inland sea in the world. Climate and Plant Life Russians sometimes joke that winter lasts for 12 months and then sum- mer begins. Russia is a cold country. The reason is its northern location partly within the Arctic Circle. In general, Russia has short summers and long, snowy winters. The climate is milder west of the Urals and grows colder and harsher as one goes north and east. Because of the climate, the majority of Russia’s population lives west of the Urals and is more concen- trated in the south than the north. Russia’s northern coast is tundra. Winters are dark and bitterly cold, and the brief summers are cool. Much of the ground is permafrost, or permanently frozen soil. Only small plants such as mosses grow. Distance from the sea affects the amount of precipitation the region gets, as well as its temperatures. Most of the region’s moisture comes from the Atlantic Ocean. The air coming from the ocean loses its moisture as it travels farther and farther inland. Russia’s Climate and Plant Life In the photo on the left, Russians bundled up in furs hurry through the snow and cold of Moscow, the capital. In the photo above, evergreen forest called taiga blankets a Russian plain. In the distance, the low Ural Mountains mark the division between Europe and Asia.Reading Check Summarize What are the major landforms in Russia and the Caucasus? Module 17558 558 Module 17, Lesson 1 COLLABORATIVE LEARNING Climate of the Caucasus 1. Organize the class into pairs. Remind students that a region’s climate impacts how the people there live. Ask students what they can learn about the way people live in the Caucasus by studying the map. 2. Have students write four questions about the Caucasus—two that cannot be answered from the map and two that can be. Then have students exchange questions with their partners and ask each other their questions. 3.

This huge forest covers about half of Russia. In Siberia, snow covers the taiga much of the year. South of the taiga is a flat grassland called the steppe ( /s.sc/t.sc/e.sc/p.sc ). With rich, black soil and a warmer climate, the steppe is Russia’s most important farming area. Climate in the Caucasus, on the other hand, ranges from warm and wet along the Black Sea, to cooler in the uplands, to hot and dry in much of Azerbaijan. Moist air from the Mediterranean Sea contributes to a humid subtropical climate zone. The region’s health resorts were a favorite destination of tourists until ethnic conflict made traveling there dangerous. Like Russia, the Caucasus boasts some impressive forests, including oak, beech, pine, birch, and aspen trees, at various elevations in the mountain s. Wildflowers blanket the mountains. In fact, many experts consider the Caucasus to be one of the most biologically diverse regions on Earth. The climate and soil also make the region a good area for farming and commercial agriculture. Natural Resources Russia has a wealth of resources. The Northern European Plain and the steppe provide fertile soil for farming. The taiga provides wood for build- ing and paper products.

Russia’s main energy resources are coal, hydroelectricity, natural gas , and oil. Russia has large oil and gas fields. Oil also lies beneath the Caspian Sea. As a result, oil, natural gas, and coal are among Russia’s largest exports. Russia’s natural resources have been poorly managed, however. Until the early 1990s this region was part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government put more importance on industry than on managing its resources. In Russia, many people chose to live in the south and west not only for the climate but because resources in this part of the country were easier to reach. However, many of the resources that were easy to access are gone. For example, most of the timber in western Russia has been cut down. Many remaining resources are in remote Siberia.

Lesson 1 Assessment Physical Features Climate and Plants Natural Resources Module 17 560 560 Module 17, Lesson 1 Online Assessment 1. Which of the following is true of Russia’s geography? Russia’s longest river is the Volga. Russia’s deepest lake is the Caspian Sea. Russia is nearly twice as large as the United States. Russia spans the two continents of Europe and Africa. Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. Russia is the world’s largest country and is nearly twice the size of the United States. 2. Why do most Russians live west of the Ural Mountains? There are few rivers east of the Ural Mountains. The climate is milder southwest of the Ural Mountains. There are few natural resources east of the Ural Mountains. The land northwest of the Ural Mountains is free of permafrost. Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. The majority of Russians live west of the Ural Mountains because the climate is milder than in the east. 3. Which statement is an accurate description of Russia’s natural resources? The Caspian Sea area supplies the Russian economy with coal. The steppe region supplies the Russian economy with paper products. The Northern European Plain supplies the Russian economy with gold. The taiga region supplies the Russian economy with building materials. Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. The taiga is a large, forested area that supplies Russia with building materials and paper products.4. Draw Conclusions Why is travel difficult on Siberia’s rivers for part of the year? Many of Siberia’s rivers flow north to the Arctic Ocean. The Lena, Ob, and Yenisey Rivers are frozen much of the year. The ice makes travel difficult on these rivers and causes many of Russia’s northern ports to close during the winter months. 5. Analyze Information Why is the Russian steppe the country’s most important farming area? The steppe has rich, black soil and a warm climate. The area is relatively flat, making the region ideal for farming. 6. Analyze Issues Why have Russia’s natural resources been poorly managed? Until the early 1900s, Russia was part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union placed more importance on developing industry than on properly managing natural resources. As a result, many natural resources are more difficult to access. For example, many forests close to population centers in the west have been cut down, limiting the supply of timber.

Everyone is talking about new freedoms and a new kind of government. What new freedoms do you hope to have? The Russian Empire Russia’s roots lie in the grassy, windswept plains of the steppe. For thousands of years, people from Asia moved across the steppe. These groups of people included the Slavs. As you may have read, the Slavs settled in Eastern Europe, including what is now Ukraine and western Russia. Early History and Empire The Slavs developed towns and began trading with people from other areas. In the AD 800s, Viking traders from Scandinavia invaded the Slavs. These Vikings were called Rus (ROOS), and the word Russia probably comes from their name. The Vikings shaped the first Russian state among the Slavs. This Russian state, called Kievan (KEE-e-fuhn) Rus, centered around the city of Kiev. This city is now the capital of Ukraine. Over time, missionaries introduced the Orthodox Christian faith to Kiev. In addition, the missionaries introduced a form of the Greek alphabet called Cyrillic (suh-RI-lik). The Russians adopted this Cyrillic alphabet and still use it today. The alphabet is one of several factors that separate Russian, a Slavic language, from languages spoken in Europe such as French and Italian, which came from Latin. The Slavs came from Asia and moved to Europe by AD 1000. They founded a number of small kingdoms in the area now known as the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In the 1200s fierce Mongol invaders called Tatars (TAH-ters) swept out of Central Asia and con- quered Kiev. The Mongols let Russian princes rule over local states. In time, Muscovy became the strongest state. Its main city was Moscow.Lesson 2 Russia The Big Idea Strict rule, unrest, and ethnic diversity have shaped Russia’s history and culture.

ARCTIC After about 200 years, Muscovy’s prince, Ivan III, seized control from the Mongols. In the 1540s his grandson, Ivan IV, crowned himself czar (ZAHR). Czar is Russian for “caesar.” As czar, Ivan IV had total power. A cruel and savage ruler, he became known as Ivan the Terrible. Muscovy developed into Russia. Strong czars such as Peter the Great (1682–1725) and Catherine the Great (1762–1796) built Russia into a huge empire and a world power. This empire included many conquered peoples. At this time, Russia built a series of fortresses across the steppe called the Orenburg Line. These fortresses served to support trade that came in from the Indian Ocean and traveled the Silk Roads from east to west. They protected caravans from steppe tribes, letting merchants as far away as India and the Ottoman Empire send spices, teas, cotton, silk, and many other commodities to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and European cities. Along with these welcome trade goods came an unwelcome traveler: disease. Illnesses such as the Black Death found their way into Russia via these trade routes as early as 1351. The spread of other contagious illnesses and parasites have also been traced to these trade routes. Still, by the 19th century, a north-south trans-Eur asian “Cotton Road” arose. With the spread of the Industrial Revolution , technologies such as textile mills demanded cotton. Cotton could not be produced in Russia due to the climate. Still, Russian industrialists could keep their textile mills humming thanks to merchants who transported it both overland and across the ocean from India, Egypt, and the United States. Many Central Asian farmers grew cotton as a cash crop to export to Russia. But Russia remained a country of poor farmers. The czars and nobles had most of the wealth. In the early 1900s Russians demanded improve- ments. The czar agreed to some changes, but unrest continued to grow.Interpret Maps 1. Location What city is located in territory gained by 1725? 2.

READING CHECK Sequence What series of events led to the creation of the Soviet Union? During World War I, Russia experienced severe shortages and unrest, which led the czar to lose support and give up the throne in 1917. That same year, the Bolsheviks seized power, starting the Russian Revolution. In 1922 Bolshevik leaders formed the Soviet Union, or Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. War and Revolution In 1914 Russia entered World War I. The country suf - fered huge losses in the war. In addition, the Russ ian people experienced severe food shortages. When the czar seemed to igno re the people’s hard- ship, they rose up against him. He was forced to gi ve up his throne in 1917. Later that year, the Bolsheviks, a radical Russian Communist group, seized power in the Russian Revolution. They then k illed the czar and his family. In 1922 the Bolsheviks formed a new country , the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), or the Soviet Union. It soon included 15 repub- lics, the strongest of which was Russia. The first leader was Vladimir Lenin. The Soviet Union The Soviet Union adopted communism. In this political system, the gov- ernment owns all property and controls all aspects of life. In 1924 Lenin died. Joseph Stalin took power, ruling as a brutal and paranoid dictator. The Soviet Union under Stalin Under Stalin, the Soviet Union set up a command economy. In this system, the government owns all businesses and farms and makes all decisions. People were told what to make and how much to charge. Without competition, though, efficiency and the quality of goods fell over time. The Soviet Union strictly controlled its people as well as its economy. Stalin had anyone who spoke out against the government jailed, exiled, or killed. Millions of people were sent to gulags, harsh Soviet labor camps often located in Siberia.

A War Commemorative St. Basil’s Cathedral was built to commemorate Ivan the Terrible’s capture of the strongholds of Kazan and Astrakhan. He named the cathedral The Cathedral of the Intercession of the Virgin. But the name St. Basil comes from Basil the Blessed, who is said to have foretold a great fire in Moscow in 1547. He was also known to have opposed Ivan the Terrible’s cruelty. After Ivan’s death, a chapel was built for St. Basil and added to the cathedral. COLLABORATIVE LEARNING The Making of a Cathedral 1.

The Cold War helped cause the Soviet Union’s fall because it cost too much money when the Soviet economy was already near collapse. Soviet Union to protect it from invasion. To do so, he set up Communist governments in Eastern Europe. The United States opposed communism and saw its spread as a threat to democracy. This opposition led to the Cold War, a period of tense rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States. The two rival countries became superpowers as they competed to have superior weapons. Partly because of the high costs of weapons, the Soviet economy neared collapse by the 1980s. Mikhail Gorbachev (GAWR-buh-chawf), the Sovie t leader, reduced government control and introduced some democracy. Still, the Soviet republics pushed for independence . In 1991 the Soviet Union broke into 15 independent countries, includin g Russia. Russia’s Culture Today In the Soviet Union, the government had controlled culture just like everything else. Today, Russian culture is once again alive and vibrant. People and Religion Russia is big and diverse, with more than 140 million people. About 80 percent are ethnic Russians, or Slavs, but Russia also has many other ethnic groups. The largest are the Tatars and Ukrainians. Rus- sia’s many ethnic groups once again take great pride in their cultures. Like ethnic culture, religious worship has revived. The Soviet government opposed religion and closed many houses of worship. Today, many have reopened, including historic Russian cathedrals wit h their onion-shaped domes. The main faith is Russian Orthodox Christian . Other religions include other forms of Christianity, Islam, Judaism , and Buddhism. Customs Russian history has shaped its customs, such as holidays. Religious holidays, like Easter, Christmas, and the Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha, are popular. The main family holiday is New Year’s Eve. To celebrate this holiday, families decorate a tree where, according to Russ ian folklore, Grandfather Frost and his helper the Snow Maiden leave gifts. Russian Independence Day marks the end of the Soviet Union on June 12. The Arts and Sciences Russia has made great contributions in the arts and sciences. Russia’s ballet companies are world famous for their skill. Peter Tchaikovsky (chy-KAWF-skee) is Russia’s most famous composer. His many works include The Nutcracker ballet and the 1812 Overture . In the material arts, Russia’s Fabergé eggs are priceless. Gifts for the czars, these eggs are made of precious metals and covered with gems such as emeralds and rubies. Each egg opens to reveal a tiny surprise. In the sciences, Russia has contributed to space research. In 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in sp ace. Russian scientists now help work on the International Space Station. The Russian Federation Today For decades, the Soviet Union reigned as a superpower, with Russia as its strongest republic. In 1991 the Soviet Union broke apart. Russia’s leaders struggled to change its government from communism to democracy.

The Russian Federation—Russia—is a federal republic. An elected president appoints the prime minister, and a legislature called the Federal Assembly makes the Federation’s laws. Describe How has the Russian economy changed in the Russian Federation? The economy is shifting away from a command economy toward a market economy; there is much less government control of the economy, and businesses and farms are now privately owned, spurring economic growth.

Russian caviar from the Caspian Sea is such a popular delicacy that it is in great demand. Many researchers worried that the Caspian Sea’s sturgeon may become extinct because of over- fishing—and because of increasing pollution of the sea. Caviar production in the region was halted for a time to allow fish stocks to recover. However, some researchers feel that fish stocks need even more time to recover to make caviar production in the Caspian Sea sustainable.

The voters elect a president to serve as the country’s chief executive, Russia’s most powerful official. The president appoints a prime minister to serve as the head of the government. A legislature, called the Federal Assembly, makes the country’s laws. Increased democracy led to more freedom for Russians. Voters can choose from several political parties. Information flows more freely. T he government no longer controls every aspect of life. The move toward democracy improved relations between Russia and Western nations. Russia’s current government system is similar in so me ways to both the parliamentary system of the UK and the federal syst em of Germany. In all three systems, a parliament or legislature is e lected by the citizens. In Germany and the UK, the prime minister is chosen by the parliament rather than by the president, unlike in Russia, where the president chooses. Changing to a democracy has been difficult. Problems such as govern- ment corruption, or dishonesty, have slowed the development of a free society. Time will tell whether Russia will continue to grow as a democracy. Economy With the move to democracy, Russia began shifting to a market economy. This type of economy is based on free trade and competition. The Russian government greatly reduced its control of the economy. Most businesses and farms are now privately owned. These changes brought economic growth, improving daily life for many of Russia’s citizens. Stil l, most of Russia’s wealth remains in the hands of a small number of people. Today, Russia produces and exports oil, natural gas, timber, metals, and chemicals. Heavy industry, such as machinery, is still important. But ligh t industry, such as clothing and electronics, has grown, and service indu s- tries now make up the largest part of Russia’s economy. In agriculture, Russia is now a major grower and exporter of grains. Other major crops are fruits, potatoes, and sugar beets. The small region of Kaliningrad—only slightly bigger than Connecticut—is more than 200 miles (322 km) from the rest of Russia. So why would Russia want this area? The reason has to do with the country’s cold climate. Kaliningrad is Russia’s only Baltic seaport that is free of ice all year. This important port provides Russia with year-round access to profitable European markets and trade. Railroads connect the port to Russia’s major cities, as the map to the right shows.

Misconception Alert Contrary to popular belief, Moscow’s Red Square is named neither for the color of the nearby buildings nor in honor of the Communist Party that ruled the former Soviet Union. Originally, the area was called Trinity Square in honor of Trinity Cathedral, which stood on the southern end of the square during the reign of Ivan III. Beginning in the 17th century, Russians began calling the square by its current name, “Krasnaya Ploschad. ” The name is related to the word krasnyi , which meant “beautiful” in Old Russian and later came to mean “red. ” History Humor What do you call it when a computer system keeps freezing?

The shift to a more democratic government and a market economy has caused economic growth, with more consumer goods available. City and Rural Life Cities show the changes sweeping Russia, with more restaurants and shopping centers available. Stores offer a wider range o f consumer goods, such as TVs. Some wealthy Russians can afford luxuries. However, the average Russian’s standard of living remains low. About 75 percent of all Russians live in cities. Most live in small apart- ments in high-rise buildings. In rural areas, more people live in houses. Russians living in cities can enjoy nature. Cities often have large parks and wooded areas in and around them. Many richer Russians own dachas, or Russian country houses, where they can garden and enjoy the fresh air. Culture Regions Russia is vast and diverse. Therefore, we divide it into several culture regions, as the map on the next page shows. These regions differ in features such as population, natural resources, and economic activity. The four western culture regions make up Russia’s heartland. Most of Russia’s people live here, where the country’s capital and largest cities ar e. The fertile plains here are the country’s most productive farming area. The Moscow Region Moscow is Russia’s capital and largest city. The mod- ern city has wide boulevards and large public squares. Its many cultural attractions include the world-famous Bolshoi Ballet and Moscow Circ us. At Moscow’s heart is the Kremlin, the center of Russia’s government. In Russian, kremlin means “fortress.” The Kremlin consists of several buildings surrounded by a wall and towers. The buildings include not only government offices but also palaces, museums, and gold-domed church es. Next to the Kremlin is Red Square, an immense plaza. It is lined by many famous landmarks, such as St. Basil’s Cathedral. The Moscow region is Russia’s most important economic area. Its facto- ries produce a wide range of goods. The city is also a transportation center and links by road, rail, and plane to all parts of Russia. The St. Petersburg Region St. Petersburg , founded by Peter the Great, was styled after cities in Western Europe. For 200 years, it served as Rus- sia’s capital and home to the czars. It has wide avenues, grand palaces, and numerous canals. Theaters and museums enrich the city’s cultural life . St. Petersburg’s location on the Gulf of Finland has made the city a major port and trade center. This northern location produces “White Nights,” a period during summer when it never gets totally dark. The Volga and Urals Regions The Volga River and Ural Mountains are the third and fourth regions. The Volga is a major shipping route. Dams along its course form lakes and give hydroelectric power. Factories here process oil and gas. A site on the Caspian Sea gives sturgeon, a fish that lays eggs called black caviar. The eggs are a costly delicacy, or rare and valued food. The Ural Mountains are an important mining region a nd produce nearly every major mineral. Smelters, factories that process metal ores, process copper and iron. The Urals region is also known for gems and semiprecious stones.Reading Check Summarize How has Russia changed since it became independent?

It is a political, cultural, and transportation center.Siberia East of the Urals lies Siberia. In the Tatar language, Siberia means “Sleeping Land.” Long, severe Siberian winters mean that much of the land lies frozen or buried under snow for most or all of the year. Its harsh climate makes its many valuable resources difficult to access. Siberia’s main industries are lumber, mining, and oil production. Large coal deposits are mined in southwest Siberia. Rivers produce hydroelectr ic power. The warmer southern steppes are Siberia’s main farmlands. Because of Siberia’s harsh climate, jobs there pay high wages. Even so, few people choose to live in Siberia. Most towns and cities are in the western and southern parts of the region. These cities tend to follow the Russia’s culture regions show tremendous diversity. They include, among others, the Western-looking St. Petersburg region (1), the politically focused Moscow region (2), and the harsh but resource-rich Siberia region (3).Russia: Culture Regions 1 22 31 3 Russia and the Caucasus 567 Russia and the Caucasus 567 READING CHECK Find Main Ideas What areas make up Russia’s culture regions?

The Russian Far East Russia’s long coastline on the Pacific Ocean is the Russian Far East. Much land remains heavily forested. In the few cities, factories process forest and mineral resources. Farming occurs in the Amur River valley. The city of Vladivostok is a naval base and the area’s main sea- port. Islands off the coast provide oil, minerals, and commercial fishing . Russia’s Challenges Russia has made great progress since 1991, but challenges remain. First, Russia’s shift to a market economy has brought problems. Prices and unem- ployment have risen. The gap between rich and poor has widened. Second, Russia’s population is falling. More Russians are dying than are being born, in part because many Russians cannot afford good health care. Third, the Soviet government did not prevent enviro nmental problems. Pollution, such as industrial chemicals, has seriou sly harmed Russia’s envi- ronment. The government must now repair the damage. Yet, because much of Russia’s wealth comes from selling natural resou rces such as fossil fuels, many in both Russia’s government and private sector s hesitate. They may fear that tackling these problems will weaken the countr y’s economy. Also, deforestation due to illegal logging in Russia’s northwest and far east regions caused higher levels of both erosion and carbon dioxide, and harmed the plants and animals that live in those forests. In late 2013, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin stated that environmental conditi ons in a significant percentage of the country were unsatisfactory and that the country must change its policies.Reading Check Find Main Ideas What areas make up Russia’s culture regions?

In 2013 the Ukrainian president said that he would be abandoning an agreement with Europe in order to seek closer ties to Russia. Many in Ukraine protested this move, and the president was forced to flee. Crimea, however, is ethnically 60 percent Russian. Protesters in this region sought to secede from Ukraine. Violent protests included assault troops taking over the Crimean parliament. A referendum was held in which Crimean citizens supposedly voted overwhelmingly to leave Ukra ine and join the Russian Federation. Russia annexed Crimea in an aggressive act that Ukraine and most other countries insist was a violation of international law. Last, Russia faces ethnic conflicts, such as those in the Russian republic of Chechnya (CHECH-nyah) in the Caucasus Mountains. Some in th is Muslim area want independence. Fighting and terrorism ther e have caused many deaths. Summary and Preview In this lesson you learned that Russia had a long, contentious history and is now a federal republic with a market economy.

Russia and the Caucasus 569 Russia and the Caucasus 569 Print Assessment (continued) Critical Thinking 7. Make a chart that compares the locations, climates, and natural resources of Russia and the United Kingdom. Then answer the question below. Location : Russia—straddling the continents of Europe and Asia; United Kingdom—west of Europe’s mainland; southern part of Northern Europe Climate : Russia—typically long, cold winters, with short summers United Kingdom—mild summers, frequent rainfall, mild climate due to the North Atlantic drift Natural Resources: Russia—oil, minerals, lumber, coal United Kingdom—oil, natural gas, lumber Compare How does the location, climate, and natural resources of the UK and Russia affect where people live and how they trade? In Russia, people mostly live in the west and south because the climate is not as harsh and natural resources are easier to get to. Goods travel over land by rail and by sea often go through Kaliningrad, a port that is free of ice all year. In the United Kingdom, fewer people live in the north because the climate of the southern part of the country is warmer. People have also settled where there are natural resources. Ports are free of ice year-round, and the United Kingdom’s location on the Atlantic enables it to trade globally, including with the United States. Online Assessment 1. Why did Russia remain a country of poor farmers well into the 20th century? The Tatars continued to invade and disrupt Russia. There was no industrial development in the country. There were few trading networks throughout Russia. The czar and many nobles controlled the wealth of the nation. Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. Most Russians remained poor farmers because the czar and nobles controlled the wealth of the nation. 2. Why did Joseph Stalin encourage the establishment of Eastern European Communist governments after World War II? to spread democracy to promote free trade to protect his country from future invasions to ensure that individual rights were respected Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. Because the Soviet Union had been invaded during World War II, Joseph Stalin helped set up a buffer zone against future invasions by establishing Communist governments in Eastern Europe . 3. How has life in Russia changed since the fall of the Soviet Union? Scientific research in space has ended. Russian Independence Day is no longer celebrated. Ethnic groups have less freedom to express their cultures. Participation in Russian Orthodox Church services has increased. Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, participation in religious services has increased and Russia’s main faith, Orthodox Christianity , has enjoyed a revival.4. How are the governments of Russia and Germany different? In Germany the citizens choose the legislature, while in Russia the prime minister chooses the legislature.

Why did Russia believe that the claiming of Crimea was justified? The Crimean parliament was invaded by force. The majority of Crimean citizens are ethnic Russians. The Ukrainian president was forced to leave his country over Crimea. The Russian takeover of Crimea may have been against international law. Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. The majority of Crimea’s citizens are ethnic Russians who voted in a referendum to join the Russian Federation. 7. Draw Conclusions How did Viking invasions and religious missionaries affect the Slavs? Name one political and one cultural change. Viking traders invaded Russia during the 800s and established the first Russian state, Kievan Rus, in what is now the modern state of Ukraine. These Vikings were called the Rus, and the name Russia probably came from their name. Missionaries brought Orthodox Christianity and the Cyrillic alphabet to Kievan Rus, and the Slavs adopted these to form their national religion and Russian language. 569a Module 17, Lesson 2 8. Cause and Effect How did the Cold War help cause the Soviet Union’s collapse? The Cold War was a conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States in which each country competed against each other by building superior weapons and trying to limit the political influence of the other. The construction of these weapons was expensive and helped cause economic problems for the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union could not compete with the United States, and this economic difficulty helped cause the Soviet Union’s collapse by 1991. 9. Summarize How has Russia’s history shaped its citizens’ holiday celebrations? The Russian Orthodox Church has influenced Russians’ celebration of Easter and other religious holidays. Russian folklore has shaped the celebration of New Year’s Eve, when family members decorate a tree under which Grandfather Frost and his helper, the Snow Maiden, leave presents. The end of the Soviet Union is celebrated during Russia’s Independence Day. 10. Analyze Issues Why has the change from a Communist to a democratic nation been difficult for Russia? The change from the Communist Soviet Union to a democratic Russia has been difficult because of government corruption and dishonesty. The economy has shifted from a government-controlled one to a market economy, where more consumer products are created. However, most of the nation’s wealth is controlled by a small number of people. 11. Compare and Contrast How are Moscow and St. Petersburg similar? Explain two characteristics. Moscow and St. Petersburg have been capitals throughout Russia’s history. St. Petersburg was founded by Peter the Great and served as the nation’s capital for 200 years. Moscow is the current capital of Russia. Both cities are important centers of economic activity and culture. St. Petersburg is a major port and home to the Hermitage Museum. Moscow is in the most important economic zone of the nation and is home to the Bolshoi Ballet and beautiful buildings. 12. Analyze Issues Why has Russia’s population declined from 1995 to the present? Explain two reasons. Russia’s population has declined in recent years for a number of reasons. The majority of Russians do not have access to good health care. This is in part explained by the widening gap between the rich and the poor and the increase in poverty rates. Pollution has been a problem since the Soviet era and has caused many people to become sick.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS continued from page 562 STRUGGLING READERS Timeline of Russian History 1.

Students will explore physical features and climate of the region. If YOU lived there . . . You live in Tbilisi, the capital of the country of Georgia. Several years ago, your sister and her college friends joined the Rose Revolution, a political protest that forced a corrupt president to resign. The protesters’ symbol was a red rose. Since the protest, you have become more interested in politics. What kind of government do you want? History The Caucasus lies in the rugged Caucasus Mountains between the Black and Caspian seas. Located where Europe blends into Asia, it reflects a range of cultural influences. Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Turks, and Mongols have all ruled or invaded the area. The Russians took control in the early 1800s. Russian control in the Caucasus did not include wha t is now western Armenia. The Ottoman Turks held this area. Over time, the Turks grew to distrust the Armenians, however, and in the late 1800s began abusing and killing them. During W orld War I (1914–1918), the Turks forced all Armenians to leav e. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians died during this ethnic c leansing, or attempt to remove an ethnic group. The Turks lost W orld War I, though, and had to give up western Armenia. After World War I, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia gained independence—but not for long. By the early 1920s they were part of the vast Soviet Union. Finally, in 1991, when the Soviet Union fell, the Caucasus republics achieved true independence. The Caucasus Today The Caucasus may have a long history, but the Caucasus coun- tries do not. Like other former Soviet republics, these young countries have had to create new governments and economies. Meanwhile, ethnic unrest and conflicts have slowed progress.
