One\nwell-known culture region is the Arab world. As you can see in\nthe Arab Culture Region feature, this culture region spreads\nacross Southwest Asia and North Africa. In this region, most\npeople write and speak Arabic and are Muslim. They also\nshare other traits, such as foods, music, styles of clothing, and\narchitecture.\nOccasionally, a single culture region dominates an entire\ncountry. In Japan, for example, one primary culture dominates\nthe country. Nearly everyone in Japan speaks the same lan-\nguage and follows the same practices. Many Japanese bow to\ntheir elders as a sign of respect and remove their shoes when\nthey enter a home.\nA single country may also include more than one culture\nregion within its borders. Mexico is one of many countries that\nis made up of different culture regions. People in northern\nM exico and southern Mexico, for example, have different culture\ntraits.

As you have\nteens enjoy a game already learned, an Arab culture region dominates much of Southwest Asia\nof lacrosse. and North Africa. Another example is the Kurdish culture region, home to\nthe Kurds, a people that live throughout Turkey, Iran, and Iraq.\nCultural Diversity As you just learned, countries may contain several\nculture regions within their borders. Often, these culture regions are\nbased on ethnic groups. An ethnic group is a group of people who share\na common culture and ancestry. Members of ethnic groups often share\ncertain culture traits such as language and special foods. Religion can also\nbe a shared culture trait within an ethnic group.\nPeople in different ethnic groups can be part of the same religious group.\nFor example, many people around the world practice the religion of Juda-\nism. However, a Jewish person from Hungary would not be in the same\nethnic group as a Jewish person from Ethiopia. These two people may share\nreligious beliefs, but they do not have the same ethnic background. In con-\ntrast, people can be in the same ethnic group and have different religious\nbeliefs. For example, there are Christian and Muslim Arabs.\nSome countries are home to a variety of ethnic groups. For example,\nmore than 100 different ethnic groups live in the East African country\nof Tanzania. Countries with many ethnic groups are culturally diverse.\nA multicultural society is a society that includes a variety of cultures in\nthe same area. While multiculturalism creates an interesting mix of ideas,\nbehaviors, and practices, it can also lead to conflict.\nIn some countries, ethnic groups have been in conflict. In Canada, for\nexample, some French Canadians want to separate from the rest of Canada\nto preserve their language and culture. In the 1990s, ethnic conflict in the\nAfrican country of Rwanda led to extreme violence and bloodshed.\n98 Module 3\nCOMPARE AND CONTRAST\nEthnic Groups in Different Countries 3.

After a few years,\nwhen the soil\u2019s nutrients have been used up, farmers move to a new area.\nToday, in dry regions of the United States, farmers use a technique called\ncenter-pivot irrigation, which uses a sprinkler system in the center of a\nlarge, circular field. The long arms of the sprinkler circle over the field to\nwater crops.\nNatural Hazards Weather can be harsh and sometimes deadly. People\ncan adapt to their environment by preparing for natural hazards such as\nfires, tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes. They change what they do\nto stay safe based on the climate. These preparations may include build-\ning storm shelters or having drills to practice what to do in an emergency.\nMost schools have fire drills to practice leaving the building. Depending on\nthe weather in a location, some schools have tornado drills or earthquake\ndrills. Cities also have building codes for new buildings and structures.\nThese codes are rules that tell what must be done to keep a building safe\nwhen people use it.\nIn the past, people did not have the tools to prepare for natural hazards.\nOne example is the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia. The\neruption scattered tons of ash, dust, and gas into the atmosphere. In the\naftermath, there were food shortages and disease outbreaks. This led to a\nmass migration of people searching for a better place to live.\nDuring tornadoes,\npeople often seek\nshelter in basements or\ninterior rooms.\n120 Module 3\nLINK TO MATHEMATICS\nCalculate Tornado Percentages 3.

For example, when a dam is built, it could\ndisrupt an aquatic ecosystem, or the community of plants and animals\nthat live along the river. Blocking the flow of water could change the\namount of water downstream, block migration routes, and even change\nthe water chemistry. These changes could, in turn, affect the survival of\nmany river species.\nHuman activities can also change environmental conditions in larger\nregions. An urban heat island occurs in large cities that are densely covered\nwith roads, concrete, and buildings. These human features make an area\ndrier and trap heat, causing parts of the city to be hotter than surround-\ning, less developed areas.\nGeographers are especially concerned with how human activities con-\ntribute to global environmental challenges, such as pollution, acid rain,\nland degradation, ozone depletion, and global warming. Such challenges\npose a threat to all people and places. For example, the ozone layer helps\nprotect living things from the sun\u2019s harmful rays. Scientists have found\nthat human activities have depleted, or used up, areas of the ozone layer.\nSpecifically, chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) cause ozone\ndepletion.

CFCs were phased out beginning in 1987, but the ozone layer\nwas already damaged. Scientists think this aggravated problems associated\nwith global warming, such as severe storms and rising sea levels.\nPeople have different perspectives on environmental issues. The\nargument over hydraulic fracturing offers an example. Also known as\nfracking, this process breaks up rock by injecting large amounts of water\nand chemicals into cracks. This procedure forces cracks in the rock to\nwiden, which allows oil and gas to flow out. In the United States, those\nagainst fracking have concerns that the process will significantly damage\nthe environment or contaminate drinking water. Supporters claim that\nit will reduce dependence on foreign oil and boost economies with the\nproduction of homeland fuel.\nSome people believe that government intervention is the best way to\nprevent businesses and individuals from depleting natural resources. Gov-\nernments around the world have enacted policies in an effort to protect\nland, freshwater, air, and ocean resources.

As the name suggests, South Korea\u2019s government is a republic.\nIt is headed by a president and an assembly elected by the people, much\nlike the United States is. In fact, the United States helped create South\nKorea\u2019s government after World War II. It also helped South Korea eco-\nnomically in the years after the war.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, South Korea was an impov-\nerished nation. Today, South Korea\u2019s economy is one of the strongest in\nEast Asia. Korean business leaders and government officials have worked\ntogether to ensure that the economy stays strong. In recent years, South\nKorea has become a major manufacturing country, exporting goods to\nplaces all around the world.\nEducation and Employment Education also played a large role in the\ndramatic growth of South Korea\u2019s economy. Since the 1950s, South\nKorea experienced an educational revolution. The literacy rate for South\nKorea in 1945 was about 22 percent. Today, the literacy rate is almost 99\npercent.

Not all Buddhists could agree on their beliefs\nand practices. Eventually, disagreements between Buddhists led to a split\nwithin the religion. Two major branches of Buddhism were created\u2014\nTheravada and Mahayana.\nMembers of the Theravada branch tried to follow the Buddha\u2019s teach-\nings exactly as he had stated them. Mahayana Buddhists, though, believed\nthat other people could interpret the Buddha\u2019s teachings to help people\nreach nirvana. Both branches have millions of believers today, but Maha-\nyana is by far the larger branch.\nAs immigrants have moved from Asia around the world, Buddhism has\nspread globally, including to the United States. As Buddhism has spread, it\nhas continued to influence the arts in India and around the world. Mod-\nern cultural products around the world show Buddhism\u2019s influence. For\nexample, a television show called Buddha was created in India in 2013 and\nhas been broadcast in countries around the world. It depicts the life of Sid-\ndhartha Gautama and how he became the Buddha.\nCustoms and Traditions Both branches of Buddhism have some tradi-\ntions and customs in common. For example, gifts play an important role\nin the customs of Buddhism. People can worship the Buddha by showing\nrespect or giving gifts. Buddhists can present their gifts at shrines dedi-\ncated to the Buddha. Worshipers can also give gifts to monks.

Location About how far is New Zealand from Australia?\nNew Zealand New Zealand, located about 1,200 miles (1,931 km) south-\neast of Australia, includes two main islands, North Island and South\nIsland. North Island is covered by hills and coastal plains. It is also home\nto volcanoes, geysers, and hot springs. One of the key features on South\nIsland is a large mountain range called the Southern Alps. Thick forests,\ndeep lakes, and even glaciers are found in the Southern Alps. The rest of\nthe island is covered by fertile hills and rich plains. Fjords, or narrow inlets\nof the sea, create many natural harbors along the coasts of both islands.\nClimates The climates of Australia and New Zealand differ greatly.\nBecause much of Australia has desert and steppe climates, temperatures\nare warm and rainfall is limited. However, along the coasts the climate is\nmore temperate. The majority of Australians live here because they have\nsummers that are not too hot and winters that are not too cold. Unlike\nAustralia, New Zealand is mild and wet. A marine climate brings plentiful\nrainfall and mild temperatures to much of the country.\n1004Module 32\n1004 Module 32, Lesson 1\nWildlife and Resources Both Australia and New Zealand are home to\nmany unique animals.
