# Enhanced Geography Simulations - Oregon Trail Level Detail & HMH Teaching Sequence

## CURRENT STATUS: Upgrading to Oregon Trail Level of Detail

## 1. OREGON TRAIL LEVEL ENHANCEMENT NEEDED
- [ ] Create comprehensive Teacher Guides with detailed daily implementation
- [ ] Develop Student Instruction Packets with character roles and responsibilities  
- [ ] Design detailed tracking sheets (Money Register, Supply Register, Food Register, Calendar)
- [ ] Create step-by-step activity guides with dice mechanics and decision points
- [ ] Add comprehensive journaling assignments with specific prompts
- [ ] Include detailed supply lists, shopping activities, and resource management
- [ ] Create certificates, awards, and completion materials
- [ ] Design print-ready materials with professional layout

## 2. HMH TEACHING SEQUENCE INTEGRATION
- [ ] Organize simulations in logical teaching progression
- [ ] Create Essential Questions for each simulation module
- [ ] Develop Big Ideas and Main Ideas structure
- [ ] Add lesson-by-lesson teaching guides
- [ ] Include pre-assessment and post-assessment materials
- [ ] Create supporting multimedia and interactive elements
- [ ] Design standards alignment documentation

## 3. DETAILED SIMULATION UPGRADES NEEDED (7/7)
- [ ] Earth Systems Explorer - Upgrade to Oregon Trail detail level
- [ ] Global Migration Challenge - Add comprehensive tracking sheets and daily activities
- [ ] Nation Builder Challenge - Create detailed government simulation mechanics
- [ ] Global Trade Network Game - Add economic tracking and trading mechanics
- [ ] Amazon Expedition Challenge - Create expedition tracking and survival mechanics
- [ ] Silk Road Trader Challenge - Add detailed trading simulation with dice mechanics
- [ ] Trans-Saharan Adventure - Create desert survival tracking and caravan mechanics

## 4. COMPREHENSIVE MATERIALS NEEDED FOR EACH SIMULATION
- [ ] Teacher Implementation Guide (like Oregon Trail teacher guide)
- [ ] Student Instruction Packet (like Oregon Trail student guide)
- [ ] Character Role Assignments and Responsibilities
- [ ] Detailed Tracking Sheets (multiple types per simulation)
- [ ] Daily Activity Guides with specific mechanics
- [ ] Journaling Prompts and Templates
- [ ] Supply Lists and Shopping Activities
- [ ] Dice Rolling Mechanics and Outcome Charts
- [ ] Assessment Rubrics and Completion Certificates
- [ ] Print-Ready Worksheet Collections

## 5. TEACHING SEQUENCE ORGANIZATION
- [ ] Determine optimal order for teaching simulations
- [ ] Create prerequisite knowledge charts
- [ ] Design skill-building progression across simulations
- [ ] Align with typical school year calendar
- [ ] Create pacing guides for different class schedules
- [ ] Design assessment progression across the sequence

## 6. PRIORITY: UPGRADE FIRST SIMULATION AS EXAMPLE
- [ ] Select one simulation for complete Oregon Trail-level upgrade
- [ ] Create all comprehensive materials for that simulation
- [ ] Use as template for remaining simulations
- [ ] Get feedback and refine approach before continuing
