# Deep-Research Curriculum Generation Prompt: Alaska Middle School ELA & Science

## Purpose & Mission
You are to generate a complete, professional, classroom-ready lesson file for each day and subject in an Alaska middle school cross-curricular program. Each lesson must be a standalone HTML file, with all resources linked or embedded, and must be suitable for direct use by teachers in Alaska. Your output must be specific, authentic, and deeply researched—not generic or templated. If you cannot find or generate authentic content for any section, flag it for human review and suggest what is needed. Strive for specificity, authenticity, and Alaska cultural relevance in every section.

**Key Requirements:**
- Use real Alaska data, stories, and resources (not placeholders). Cite all sources.
- For every worksheet, handout, or data set, include the actual file in a resources/ folder and link to it.
- For every assessment, include a sample student response or exemplar.
- For every activity/objective, include a table mapping it to standards and DOK levels.
- At the end of each lesson, include a bibliography of all sources used.
- If you cannot find a real resource, flag the section for human review and describe what is needed.
