# Worksheet Generation System for 32 Geography Units

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to efficiently create high-quality worksheets for all ELA and Science lessons across the 32 geography units. The goal is to produce worksheets similar to the sample PDFs while maintaining consistency and quality.

## Approach

### 1. Template-Based System

We'll create a template-based system with:

- **Master Templates**: Core worksheet structures for ELA and Science
- **Region-Specific Content**: Customizable elements for each geographic region
- **Automated Generation**: Scripts to populate templates with region-specific content

### 2. Content Extraction Process

For each of the 32 PDF teacher guides:

1. **Extract Key Information**:
   - Region-specific vocabulary
   - Geographic features
   - Cultural elements
   - Environmental systems
   - Historical context

2. **Organize Content by Category**:
   - Vocabulary terms and definitions
   - Reading passages
   - Scientific phenomena
   - System interactions
   - Writing prompts

3. **Create Region-Specific Content Database**:
   - JSON files containing structured content for each region
   - Organized by content type and lesson focus

### 3. Worksheet Generation Workflow

#### Step 1: Create Master Templates
- ELA Worksheet Template with sections for:
  - Vocabulary development
  - Close reading
  - Text analysis
  - Informative writing
  - Reflection

- Science Worksheet Template with sections for:
  - Scientific phenomenon observation
  - System identification
  - Data collection/analysis
  - Model development
  - Scientific explanation
  - Reflection

#### Step 2: Develop Content Population Scripts
- Python scripts to:
  - Read region-specific content from database
  - Insert content into appropriate template sections
  - Generate formatted worksheets (HTML or PDF)

#### Step 3: Quality Control Process
- Automated checks for:
  - Formatting consistency
  - Content completeness
  - Spelling and grammar
- Manual review of sample worksheets from each region

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (1 week)
- Create master ELA and Science worksheet templates
- Develop content extraction framework
- Set up region-specific content database structure

### Phase 2: Content Extraction (3-4 weeks)
- Process all 32 PDF teacher guides
- Extract and categorize region-specific content
- Populate content database for each region

### Phase 3: Worksheet Generation (2-3 weeks)
- Develop worksheet generation scripts
- Generate draft worksheets for all regions
- Implement quality control checks

### Phase 4: Refinement (1-2 weeks)
- Review sample worksheets
- Make template adjustments as needed
- Finalize all worksheets

## Technical Implementation

### Content Database Structure

```json
{
  "region_name": "Physical World",
  "vocabulary": [
    {"term": "Lithosphere", "definition": "The solid outer part of the Earth..."},
    {"term": "Hydrosphere", "definition": "All the waters on the Earth's surface..."},
    // Additional terms
  ],
  "reading_passages": [
    {
      "title": "Earth's Systems",
      "text": "Earth is a complex system of interacting components...",
      "main_idea": "Earth's systems constantly interact and influence one another...",
      "supporting_details": [
        "The lithosphere forms the solid foundation...",
        "The hydrosphere encompasses all water on Earth...",
        // Additional details
      ]
    },
    // Additional passages
  ],
  "scientific_phenomena": [
    {
      "title": "Earth's Systems Interaction",
      "description": "The four major Earth systems interact in complex ways...",
      "observation_prompts": [
        "What components can you identify in the model?",
        "How do these components appear to interact?",
        // Additional prompts
      ]
    },
    // Additional phenomena
  ],
  "writing_prompts": [
    "Describe one of Earth's physical systems and explain its importance.",
    "Explain how changes in one Earth system might affect the others.",
    // Additional prompts
  ],
  "reflection_questions": [
    "What new information did you learn about Earth's physical systems?",
    "What questions do you still have about how Earth's systems interact?",
    // Additional questions
  ]
}
```

### Worksheet Generation Script (Pseudocode)

```python
def generate_worksheets(region_name):
    # Load region-specific content
    content = load_region_content(region_name)
    
    # Generate ELA worksheet
    ela_worksheet = generate_ela_worksheet(content, region_name)
    save_as_pdf(ela_worksheet, f"{region_name}_ela_worksheet.pdf")
    
    # Generate Science worksheet
    science_worksheet = generate_science_worksheet(content, region_name)
    save_as_pdf(science_worksheet, f"{region_name}_science_worksheet.pdf")
    
    return ela_worksheet, science_worksheet

def generate_ela_worksheet(content, region_name):
    # Load ELA template
    template = load_template("ela_worksheet_template.html")
    
    # Populate template with region-specific content
    worksheet = template.replace("{{REGION_NAME}}", region_name)
    worksheet = populate_vocabulary_section(worksheet, content["vocabulary"])
    worksheet = populate_reading_section(worksheet, content["reading_passages"][0])
    worksheet = populate_writing_section(worksheet, content["writing_prompts"][0])
    worksheet = populate_reflection_section(worksheet, content["reflection_questions"])
    
    return worksheet

def generate_science_worksheet(content, region_name):
    # Similar implementation for science worksheet
    # ...
```

## Scaling Considerations

To efficiently handle 32 units:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Extract content from multiple PDFs simultaneously
2. **Batch Generation**: Generate worksheets in batches by region
3. **Template Refinement**: Continuously improve templates based on early results
4. **Quality Sampling**: Thoroughly review a sample from each batch before proceeding

## Output Organization

Worksheets will be organized in a clear directory structure:

```
/worksheets/
  /physical_world/
    physical_world_ela_worksheet.pdf
    physical_world_science_worksheet.pdf
  /human_world/
    human_world_ela_worksheet.pdf
    human_world_science_worksheet.pdf
  // Additional regions
```

## Next Steps

1. Create the master ELA and Science worksheet templates
2. Develop the content extraction script for PDF teacher guides
3. Set up the region-specific content database
4. Implement the worksheet generation system
5. Begin processing the highest-priority regions
