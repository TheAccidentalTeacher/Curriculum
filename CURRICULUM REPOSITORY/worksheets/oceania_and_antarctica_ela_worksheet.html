Explore the Essential Question •Tell students that people from Southeast Asia gradually settled the Pacific Islands, including Australia and New Zealand, over thousands of years. Have students examine a physical map of the Pacific Islands. Point out that many of the islands lay a g reat distance from Southeast Asia and from each other. Ask students to draw conclusions about how early people may have been able to settle these islands. •Tell students that people from Europe—Great Britain, Spain, France—began to explore and settle the islands of the Pacific in the 1500s. Lead a discussion about how this might have affected the culture in these places. Encourage students to keep the Essential Question in mind as they work through the module.
