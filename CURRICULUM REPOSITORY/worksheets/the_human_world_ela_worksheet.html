        Lesson 1 Big Idea Culture, a group’s shared practices and beliefs, differs from group to group and changes over time while maintaining features common to all societies. Main Ideas •Culture is the set of beliefs, goals, and practices that a group of people share. •The world includes many different culture groups. •New ideas and events lead to changes in culture. •The features common to all cultures are called cultural universals. •All societies have social institutions that help their groups survive. •Every culture expresses itself creatively in a variety of ways. •All societies use technology to help shape and control the environment.Lesson 2 Big Idea Population studies are an important part of geography. Main Ideas •The study of population patterns helps geographers learn about the world. •Population statistics and trends are important measures of population change.Essential Question Preview Which geographic concepts are most useful for understanding the world’s people? Have students consider the Essential Question and capture their initial responses. Explore the Essential Question •Explain that geographers understand the world’s people by studying their cultures. A culture is a set of beliefs, values, and practices that a group of people have in common. •Point out that geographers study population and settlement patterns—where people live, how many people live there, and the effects those people have on the environment. Geographers track population changes and settlement patterns and study the reasons for those changes. Encourage students to keep the Essential Question in mind as they work through the module. Help students plan inquiries and develop their own supporting questions such as: What are the key elements of culture? How are culture, population, and settlement patterns impacted by the physical environment? You may want to assign students to write a short essay in response to the Essential Question when they complete the module. Encourage students to use their notes and responses to inform their essays. Explore the Online Video ANALYZE VIDEOS Y oung People Keep Mariachi Alive Invite students to watch the video to learn how the young people of Mexico are keeping the tradition of mariachi music alive for future generations. History Why is mariachi music important to the people of Mexico? Mariachi is an important part of Mexican culture. It has a rich history dating back to the 19th century.

Events such as the Olympics can promote global connections, allowing people to learn about many different cultures. Human-Environment Interaction Ask students how the environment of the country might affect the people and culture of the country. Explain that human-environment interaction is also something geographers study. Culture Using a map ask students to select a country. Ask them to imagine a boy and a girl their age and describe how they are dressed, what their favorite foods are, and what music they might enjoy. Explain that all of these things are part of culture. Population Ask students to guess the population of the country they selected. Look up the population and e xplain that geographers study population to learn more abo ut an area and its people Analyze Visuals Have students examine the images and then answer the following question: What are some of the topics geographers study to learn about the world’s people? culture, population, settlement patterns, and human-environment interaction Online Module Flip Cards Use the flip cards as a whole class activity or in student pairs to preview the module’s Key Terms and Places. Students can guess the meaning of each word, then review its definition, or do the reverse, using the flip card’s toggle button to switch from “Term” to “Definition” mode. Students can also use the flip cards at the end of the module as a review tool before taking the Module Assessment. Online Map Activity Students can use this activity to review some of th e locations discussed in this module. To complete, ha ve students drag each label to the correct location on the map.Lesson 3 Big Idea Many factors influence where people settle and how settlements develop. Main Ideas •Natural resources and trade routes are important factors in determining location for settlements. •Areas can be defined as urban or rural. •Spatial patterns describe ways that people build settlements. •New technology has improved the interaction of regions with nearby and distant places.Lesson 4 Big Idea Specific environments present distinct opportunities for people to meet their needs and unique challenges to which they must adapt. Main Ideas •Geographers examine how environmental conditions shape people’s lives. •Human activity changes specific places, regions, and the world as a whole. Human-Environment Interaction Farming is one way that humans interact with the environment. These rice farmers in Vietnam utilize the area’s rich soil. Population Geographers study human populations, like this one in India, to learn where and why people live in certain places.Culture Thousands of different cultures make up our world. Clothing, language, and music are just some parts of culture. 93 The Human World The Human World 93 Reading Social Studies READING FOCUS Understand Main Ideas Ask students to bring in newspaper or magazine articles that interest them. Have each student read his or her article and select two or three paragraphs to work with. For each paragraph, have students identify the main idea. Then ask students to find partners with whom to exchange articles. Have students read the selected paragraphs and identify the main idea for each. When partners are finished, have them compare main ideas. Ask students if they each identified the same main idea. Y ou Try It! Main Idea: People migrate for many reasons. Details: Some factors push people to leave their country, while others pull people away; poverty and disease forced some 1.5 million people to leave Ireland during the potato famine of the mid-1800s; thousands of British citizens migrated to Australia in search of cheap land in the 1800s and early 1900s. People migrate for many reasons. Some factors push people to leave their country, while others pull people away. During the Irish potato famine of the mid-1800s, poverty and disease forced some 1.5 million people to leave Ireland. In the 1800s and early 1900s thousands of British citizens migrated to Australia in search of cheap land. YOU TRY IT! Read the following paragraph, and then use a graphic organizer to identify the main idea. Create as many circles as you need to list the supporting facts and details.A single country may also include more than one culture region within its borders. Mexico is one of many countries that is made up of different culture regions. People in northern Mexico and southern Mexico, for example, have different culture traits. The culture of northern Mexico tends to be more modern, while traditional culture remains strong in southern Mexico.Reading Social Studies Understand Main Ideas READING FOCUS Main ideas are like the hub of a wheel. The hub holds the wheel together, and everything circles around it. In a paragraph, the main idea holds the paragraph together and all the facts and details revolve around it. The main idea is usually stated clearly in a topic sentence, which may come at the beginning or end of a paragraph. Topic sentences always summarize the most important idea of a paragraph. To find the main idea, ask yourself what one point is holding the paragraph together. See how the main idea in the following example holds all the details from the paragraph together. As you read this module, find the main ideas of the paragraphs you are studying.A single country may also include more than one culture region within its borders.Mexico Northern Mexico modern cultureSouthern Mexico traditional culture 94 Module 3 94 Module 3 LESSON 1 Big Idea Culture, a group’s shared practices and beliefs, differs from group to group and changes over time while maintaining features common to all societies.

Describe What role do families play in the development of culture? pass down traditions such as foods, holiday customs, and so on Identify What is one culture trait you share with many other people around the world? What is one that is not shared by many other cultures? Possible answers: shared—love of soccer, movies, computers; not shared—particular holiday customs, education, clothing style, and so on Make Generalizations What are some culture traits that immigrants to your area have adopted from the United States? Possible answers: language, style of dress, educational system, foods, involvement in government, and so on More About . . . Food Around the World Food is a unique part of culture. Certain fish eggs, called caviar, have been a favorite in Russia for centuries, while in Japan, some types of raw fish, called sushi, have been popular for a long time. In France, geese were specially raised and overfed so their livers would taste a certain way. Today, all of these foods are enjoyed in many parts of the world.Teach the Big Idea 1. Whole Class Open/Introduction If YOU lived there . . . How can you explain what culture is? Review the scenario with students and lead a class discussion around responses to the question. You may wish to review the following points to frame your discussion. Consider the FOOD in each neighborhood: •the menus in the restaurants •the items sold in markets •the food in farmers' markets and festivals Consider neighborhood LANGUAGES: •the native languages spoken •the amount of English spoken •the languages in signs, posters, and leaflets 2. Direct Teach Introduce the Big Idea: Culture, a group’s shared practices and beliefs, differs from group to group and changes over time while maintaining features common to all societies. Ask students to name some of their family’s favorite foods. Have them describe the types of music they and other family members listen to. How do they celebrate special events, such as birthdays or anniversaries? Explain that these are all parts of a person’s culture. 3. Practice/Assess/Inquire Write three headings on the board: Culture, Culture Groups, and Culture Change . Call on students to add words or phrases under each to describe the United States. Challenge students to provide examples under each from countries other than the United States. 4. Explore (Collaborative Exploration) Ask each student to write on a piece of paper one culture that was either mentioned in the text or that they know about. They should list some culture traits and how that culture has changed. Call on students to share what they have written. 5. Whole Group Close/Reflect Ask students to discuss their own culture with a parent and make a list of some favorite culture traits. They can also discuss and list how their culture is changing. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 11: Discussions ONLINE DOCUMENT-BASED INVESTIGATION The Human World Arab Culture Region is the first of four document- based investigations that students will analyze in The Human World. Have students navigate through the carousel noting different elements of Arab culture. Lesson 1 Elements of Culture The Big Idea Culture, a group’s shared practic- es and beliefs, differs from group to group and changes over time while maintaining features com- mon to all societies. Main Ideas ■Culture is the set of beliefs, goals, and practices that a group of people share. ■The world includes many dif- ferent culture groups. ■New ideas and events lead to changes in culture. ■The features common to all cultures are called cultural universals. ■All societies have social institu- tions that help their groups survive. ■Every culture expresses itself creatively in a variety of ways. ■All societies use technology to help shape and control the environment. Key Terms and Places culture culture trait culture region ethnic group multicultural society cultural diffusion cultural universals social institutions heritage universal theme technologytechnologyIf YOU lived there . . . You live in New York City, and your young cousin from out of state has come to visit. As you take her on a tour, you point out the different cultural neighborhoods, like Chinatown, Little Italy, Spanish Harlem, and Koreatown. People speak in other languages as they venture to the nearby shops and restaurants that offer a variety of cultural goods. Your cousin can see that shopping and eating special foods are common activities for many cul- tures. Still, she isn’t quite sure what culture means or why these neighborhoods are so different from her own. How can you explain what culture is? What Is Culture? If you traveled around the world, you would experience many different sights and sounds. You would probably hear unique music, eat a variety of foods, listen to different languages, see distinctive landscapes, and learn new customs. You would see and take part in the variety of cultures that exist in our world. A Way of Life What exactly is culture? Culture is the set of beliefs, values, and practices that a group of people have in common. Culture includes many aspects of life, such as lan- guage and religion, that we may share with people around us. Everything in your day-to-day life is part of your culture — from the clothes you wear to the music you hear to the foods you eat. On your world travels, you might notice that all societies share certain cultural features. All people have some kind of government, educate their children in some way, and create some type of art or music. However, not all societies practice their culture in the same way. For example, in Japan, the school year begins in the spring and students wear school uniforms. In the United States, however, the school year begins in the late summer and most schools do not require uniforms. Differences like these are what make each culture unique. The Human World 95 The Human World 95 STRUGGLING READERS Culture Traits 1. Review the paragraph on Culture Traits with students, defining and explaining any difficult words. 2. On a classroom map or using the textbook atlas, have students locate the countries mentioned: Germany, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia. 3. Have students name the continent in which each country is located. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 21: Map Reading ONLINE GRAPHIC ORGANIZER Elements of Culture As students read the lesson, have them use the graphic organizer to take notes. Students can review their graphic organizer notes at the end of the lesson to answer the following question: Find Main Ideas How do cultures continue to change? Cultures continue to change over time as people move around the world and share new ideas. ONLINE LESSON FLIP CARDS Review Key Terms and Places Students can use the flip cards in the Lesson Review at any time to review the lesson’s key terms and places: culture, culture trait, culture region, ethnic group, multicultural society, cultural diffusion, cultural universals, social institutions , heritage, universal theme, technology. ONLINE INTERACTIVE VISUALS Image Compare: Culture Traits Have students explore and compare the images using the interactive slider. You may wish to use the associated question as a discussion prompt. Analyze Visuals What culture traits do these students share? Which are different? Shared traits include eating with friends, wearing western style clothing; different traits include manner of eating and food eaten. Culture Traits Cultural features like starting the school year in the spring or wearing uniforms are types of culture traits. A culture trait is an activity or behavior in which people often take part. The language you speak and the sports you play are some of your culture traits. Sometimes a culture trait is shared by people around the world. For example, all around the globe, people participate in the game of soccer. In places as different as Germany, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia, many people enjoy playing and watching soccer. While some culture traits are shared around the world, others change from place to place. One example of this is how people around the world eat. In China, most people use chopsticks to eat their food. In Europe, however, people use forks and spoons. In Ethiopia, many people use bread or their fingers to scoop their food. Development of Culture How do cultures develop? Culture traits are often learned or passed down from one generation to the next. Most cul- ture traits develop within families as traditions, foods, or holiday cust oms are handed down over the years. Laws and moral codes are also passed down within societies. For example, many laws in the United States can be traced back to England in the 1600s and were brought by colonists to America. Among these are the right to a speedy trial, freedom of petition, and due process of law. Cultures also develop as people learn new culture traits. Immigrants who move to a new country, for example, might learn to speak the lan- guage or eat the foods of their adopted country.Culture Traits Analyze Visuals What culture traits do these students share?

Organize the class into four teams. Assign each team an age group: children and teenagers, young adults, older adults, or seniors. Distribute magazines to each team for the age group it was assigned. 2. Have each team discuss the people in the United States in its assigned group and list some culture traits they share. Students may use the magazines to help them determine tastes in food, music, clothing, and so on.3. Ask each team to construct a collage using magazine ads or articles to illustrate the culture. 4. Have teams display their collages and answer questions about them. Ask each team whether the same age group in other cultures has similar culture traits. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 8: Collages AFRICAEUROPE ASIA N SW E Other factors, such as history and the environment, also affect how cultures develop. For example, historical events changed the langua ge and religion of much of Central and South America. In the 1500s, when the Spanish conquered the region, they introduced their language and Roman Catholic faith. The environment in which we live can also shape culture. For example, the desert environment of Africa’s Sahara influences the w ay people who live there earn a living. Rather than grow crops, they herd ani- mals that have adapted to the harsh environment. As you can see, history and the environment affect how cultures develop. Culture Groups Earth is home to thousands of different cultures. People who share simila r culture traits are members of the same culture group. Culture groups can be based on a variety of factors, such as age, language, or religion. Ameri- can teenagers, for example, can be said to form a culture group based on location and age. They share similar tastes in music, clothing, and sports. Culture Regions When we refer to culture groups, we are speaking of people who share a common culture. At other times, however, we need to refer to the area, or region, where the culture group is found. A culture region is an area in which people have many shared culture traits.Reading Check Find Main Ideas What practices and customs make up culture? Culture regions are based on shared culture traits. Southwest Asia and North Africa make up an Arab culture region based on ethnic heritage, a common language, and religion. Most people in this region are Arab, speak and writ e Arabic, and practice Islam. Many people share Arab culture traits. An Omani boy, above, and Palestinian girls, at left, share the same language and religion. Analyze Visuals What culture traits do you see in the photos?Arab Culture Region The Human World 97 The Human World 97 COMPARE AND CONTRAST Ethnic Groups in Different Countries 1. Organize the class into pairs. 2. Have each pair select two countries (not the United States). Each student will research one of the countries to determine the different ethnic groups living there, population in each group, how people in the group distinguish themselves from others (by religion, language, and so on), how they came there, and how they have cooperated or come into conflict with others.3. When the research is complete, have each pair prepare a chart with two columns that summarizes the information for the two countries. Ask each pair to compare and contrast the ethnic groups in each country. 4. Ask volunteers to share their findings with the class. Guide the class in a discussion of these findings. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 30: Research; and 11: Discussions In a specific culture region, people share certain culture traits, such as religious beliefs, language, or lifestyle. One well-known culture region is the Arab world. As you can see in the Arab Culture Region feature, this culture region spreads across Southwest Asia and North Africa. In this region, most people write and speak Arabic and are Muslim. They also share other traits, such as foods, music, styles of clothing, and architecture. Occasionally, a single culture region dominates an entire country. In Japan, for example, one primary culture dominates the country. Nearly everyone in Japan speaks the same lan- guage and follows the same practices. Many Japanese bow to their elders as a sign of respect and remove their shoes when they enter a home. A single country may also include more than one cul ture region within its borders. Mexico is one of many co untries that is made up of different culture regions. People in northern Mexico and southern Mexico, for example, have diff erent culture traits. The culture of northern Mexico tends to be more modern, while traditional culture remains strong in souther n Mexico. A culture region may also stretch across country borders. As you have already learned, an Arab culture region dominates much of Southwest Asia and North Africa. Another example is the Kurdish culture region, home to the Kurds, a people that live throughout Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. Cultural Diversity As you just learned, countries may contain several culture regions within their borders. Often, these culture regions are based on ethnic groups. An ethnic group is a group of people who share a common culture and ancestry. Members of ethnic groups often share certain culture traits such as language and special foods. Religion can also be a shared culture trait within an ethnic group. People in different ethnic groups can be part of th e same religious group. For example, many people around the world practice the religion of Juda- ism. However, a Jewish person from Hungary would no t be in the same ethnic group as a Jewish person from Ethiopia. Thes e two people may share religious beliefs, but they do not have the same et hnic background. In con- trast, people can be in the same ethnic group and h ave different religious beliefs. For example, there are Christian and Musli m Arabs. Some countries are home to a variety of ethnic groups. For example, more than 100 different ethnic groups live in the East African country of Tanzania. Countries with many ethnic groups are culturally diverse . A multicultural society is a society that includes a variety of cultures in the same area. While multiculturalism creates an interesting mix of ide as, behaviors, and practices, it can also lead to conflict. In some countries, ethnic groups have been in conflict. In Canada, for example, some French Canadians want to separate from the rest of Canada to preserve their language and culture. In the 1990s, ethnic conflict in th e African country of Rwanda led to extreme violence and bloodshed. Sports are played in cultures around the world. These Lenape teens enjoy a game of lacrosse. Module 398 98 Module 3, Lesson 1 LINK TO MUSIC Music from Other Cultures Materials: four or five different selections of music from other cultures, CD player 1. Explain to students that they will be listening to music from other cultures. Ask them to take notes as they listen, such as whether they like or dislike the music, what culture they think it comes from, how it is the same or different from music they listen to, if there are any instruments that they can identify, and so on.2. Allow everyone to listen carefully and take notes. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 18: Listening READING CHECK Make Inferences Why might multiculturalism cause conflict? Some groups want to preserve their own culture or force others to abide by their ways.Teach the Main Idea New ideas and events lead to changes in culture. Describe How did the Native American culture change after the Spanish conquered the Americas? How did the Spanish culture change? started to use horses and firearms; started to use new foods such as potatoes and chocolate Analyze How could the Internet encourage cultural diffusion? allows communication quickly between many people and cultures Make Inferences Why have immigrant groups usually adopted the language of their new home?

The Internet The Internet was first developed and used by the U.S. military in the 1970s. Today, millions of people worldwide use it. Contact through the Internet may become an important way that cultures change.

Reading Check Make Inferences Why might multiculturalism cause conflict?Although ethnic groups have clashed in some culturally diverse coun- tries, they have cooperated in others. In the United States, for example, many different ethnic groups live side by side. One major reason for this diversity is that people have migrated to the United States from all over the world. Cities and towns often celebrate their ethnic heritage with fe sti- vals and parades, like the Saint Patrick’s Day Parade in Boston or Philadel- phia’s Puerto Rican Festival. Changes in Culture You’ve read books or seen movies set in the time of the Civil War or in the Wild West of the late 1800s. Think about how our culture has changed since then. Clothing, food, music—all have changed drastically. When we study cultural change, we try to find out what factors influence the changes and how those changes spread from place to place. How Cultures Change Cultures change constantly. Some changes happen rapidly, while others take many years. What causes cultures to change? Innovation and contact with other people are two key causes of cultural change. New ideas often bring about cultural changes. For example, when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, it changed how people communicate with each other. Other innovations, such as motion pictur es, changed how people spend their free time. More recently, the creation of the Internet dramatically altered the way people find information, com - municate, and shop. Cultures also change as societies come into contact with each other. For example, when the Spanish arrived in the Americas, they introduced firearms and horses to the region, changing the lifestyle of some Native American groups. At the same time, the Spaniards learned about new foods like potatoes and chocolate. These foods then became an important part of Europeans’ diet. The Chinese had a similar influence on Korea and Japan, where they introduced Buddhism and written language. How Cultural Traits Spread You have probably noticed that a new slang word might spread from teenager to teenager and state to state. In the same way, clothing styles from New York or Paris might become popular all over the world. More serious cultural traits spread as well. Religious bel iefs or ideas about government may spread from place to place. The spread of culture traits from one region to another is called cultural diffusion. Cultural diffusion often occurs when individuals move from one place to another. For example, when European immigrants settled in the Americas, they brought their culture along with them. As a result, English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese are all spoken in the Americas. American cul- ture also spread as pioneers moved west, taking with them their form of government, religious beliefs, and customs. Another factor that leads to cultural diffusion is trade. An example of this developed along the Silk Road of ancient China. The trade route encouraged the exchange of goods and practices between Asia and the Academic Vocabulary innovation a new idea or way of doing something The Human World 99 The Human World 99 More About . . .

Search the National Geographic Society website to find links that can be used for related classroom discussions or activities. Cultural Universals In the 1940s anthropologist George Murdock examined hundreds of different cultures in an attempt to determine the general traits common to all cultures. He used his research to compile a list of more than 65 cultural universals. Among his list were the cultural universals discussed in this section, as well as cultural features such as body adornment, cooking, feasting, forms of greeting, funeral ceremonies, gift giving, housing, language, medicine, folklore and myths, sports, and medicine.

Also, the Phoenicians were an early trading civilization th at moved Middle Eastern culture throughout the Mediterranean region. The y are often called the “carriers of civilization” because of their strong i nflu- ence on other cultures. Conflict can also be a reason for cultural diffusion. Recently, millions of Syrians fled their country in a mass migration to escape civil war. Some refugees moved to neighboring countries in the Middle East. Other Syrian people traveled great distances to places such as Europe and North America. This migration contributed to the diversity of each region. Cultural diffusion also takes place as new ideas spread from place to place. As you can see on the map, the game of baseball first began in New York, then spread throughout the United States. As more and more people learned the game, it spread even faster and farther. Baseball eventually spread to other world societies. Wearing blue jeans became part of our culture in a similar way. Blue jeans originated in the American West in the mid-1800s. They gradually became popular all over the country and the world. What Do All Cultures Have in Common?

The images show elders are village chiefs and part of a special council. are so basic that societies everywhere have developed certain features to meet them. These features, common to all cultures, are called cultural universals. In this section, you will learn about three important cultural universals: social institutions, creative expressions, and techno logy. Basic Social Institutions Societies, like people, have basic needs that must be met for a group to survive. Social institutions are organized patterns of belief and behavior that focus on meeting these needs. The most basic social institutions are family, education, religion, government, and economy. The core princ iples and ideals of a society are known as cultural values. They help to shape the group and all of its social institutions. Cultural values and social instit u- tions exist in all societies. However, their specific characteristics a nd customs, or ways of doing things, vary from culture to culture. Family Family is the most basic social institution. In all societies, its purpose is the same. The family ensures that children are c ared for until old enough to fend for themselves. Families provide emotional and physical support. They also teach the accepted values, traditions, and cus toms of a culture. The traditions of a culture hold great significance and get passed along from one generation to the next. One custom in Greece is that people celebrate a “name day” for the saint that bears their name instead of their own birthday. Another tradition is the Battle of Oranges in Northern Ital y. Groups of people throw oranges to reenact a famous battle. Cultural values are also important and often have a long history within a specific culture. For example, the foundation of African cultural values is based on the past and present. This is one reason w hy elders are so respected there. The elders are to always be acknowledged and served their meals first. The size of a family can vary from one culture to a nother. Family members may live together under one roof or they mi ght inhabit an entire village. For example, India’s joint family s ystem includes grandpar- ents, parents, uncles, aunts, and all of their chil dren living in one household. Government To keep order and resolve conflicts, people need a govern- ment. A government is a system of leaders and laws that help people live safely together in their community or country. Laws help people live safel y with each other because they define standards, protect property and people’s rights, and help settle disagreements. Laws can apply to any of a society’s social institutions. For example, a country may impose a mini- mum wage law, which affects the country’s economy. Perhaps a govern- ment creates new laws for its nation’s education system. This may impact what students learn in school. Economy To support its people, a society must have an economy, or a system of using resources to meet needs. People must be able to make, buy, sell, and trade goods and services to get what they need and want. They must consider the questions of what to produce, for whom to produce, and how to produce. Prosperous nations have strong economic principles in place to guide their business decisions and actions.Reading Check Find Main Ideas What can geographers learn from cultural universals?

Recall What are the main types of creative expressions? performing arts, visual arts, literary arts Draw Conclusions Why do creative expressions vary across cultures? They vary because they are influenced by the availability of natural resources, differences in cultural heritage, and individual choices. Explain Why are cultural expressions that have universal themes significant? They contain messages about life or human nature that are meaningful to all people, across time, and in all places. More About . . . The Golden Pagoda Myanmar’s magnificent Schwedagon Pagoda, or the Golden Pagoda, sits atop a hill overlooking the city of Yangon. Believed to be about 2,500 years old, the pagoda is the most sacred Buddhist site in Myanmar. The temple is covered with hundreds of gold plates and encrusted with thousands of diamonds that sparkle in the sun’s light. According to legend, the pagoda contains eight of Buddha’s hairs. Education Societies rely on education to pass on knowledge to young people. For example, schools across the world teach reading, writing, m ath, and technical skills that prepare students to take on adult roles. Schools also teach the norms and values that sustain, or support, a society. For instance, one goal of U.S. public schools is to develop informed citizens who contribute to the good of their communities. Religion The world’s religions are incredibly diverse. Still, in all societies, religion helps explain the meanings of life and death and the difference between good and bad behavior. Over time, religion is passed down and supported by traditional practices, literature, sacred texts and sto ries, and sacred places. All of this makes religion a powerful force. It is often the foundation of a culture’s philosophical beliefs and attitudes. Moreo ver, in all world regions, it has inspired and sustained itself through great work s of devotion, including art and monumental architecture. Creative Expressions All people are creative. Everyone has the ability to imagine, think, and cre- ate. Not surprisingly, all societies express themselves creatively, too . The main types of creative expression are: • Performing Arts —art forms that combine sound and movement for an audience, such as music, theater, and dance • Visual Arts —creative expressions that have both a visual and m aterial form, such as painting, jewelry, sculpture, textile s, and architecture • Literary Arts —art forms rooted in words and language, such as literature, folktales, and storiesAcademic Vocabulary monumental impressively large, sturdy, and enduringIn the United States and in Peru, schools teach knowledge, skills, and cultural norms to prepare students for adult roles.

Look, too, for how creative expressions reflect a specific heritage, or the wealth of cultural elements that has been passed down over generations. Creative expressions also express individual choices. People use arti stic forms to express individual as well as cultural ideas about what is pleas- ing, proper, and beautiful. They also use them to address contemporary issues such as politics, war, and social inequality. This is because the arts can inspire us. Creative forms communicate ideas and emotions that stir people to action. Universal Themes Some creative expressions communicate universal themes. A universal theme is a message about life or human nature that is meaningful across time and in all places. Because they express basic human truths, universal themes transcend, or move beyond, the boundar- ies of a particular society. They speak to people everywhere. Masterpieces of art have qualities that are meaningful and timeless. Examples include Egyptian hieroglyphics and the sculptures of ancie nt Greece. The woodblock prints made by the Japanese painter Katsushika Hokusai are also an example of this type of art. They express a love of nature’s beauty, simplicity, and power.Analyze Visuals How do examples of monumental architecture express the power of religion?Religion inspires creative expressions, including monumental architecture such as France’s Notre Dame Cathedral and Shwedagon Pagoda, a Buddhist temple in Myanmar (Burma).Monumental Architecture The Human World 103 The Human World 103 ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS Technology Timelines Pair students with more proficient writers.

Contrast What is the difference between technology and science? Technology includes the use of knowledge, tools, and skills to solve problems. Science is a way of understanding the world through observation and the testing of ideas. Recall Why do the Amish in the United States refuse to use cars? They reject technology they believe will undermine their traditions. Evaluate Of Pasteur’s and Edison’s work, whose innovations do you think are more important to your daily life? Possible answer: Edison’s because I rely on electricity every day More About . . . Connect to Technology: Internet Access About 60 percent of the world’s population does not have access to the Internet because they cannot afford a computer or Internet service. Some nonprofit organizations, however, are helping to bridge the “digital divide” that exists between developed nations and developing nations. For example, one British organization works to repair used computers that are then donated to schools in developing nations. Other art forms also gain worldwide appreciation. For example, litera- ture such as The Lord of the Rings contains a universal theme of a hero’s search for truth, goodness, and honor. Blues music is another example. Derived from African American work songs and spirituals in the American South, blues songs express feelings of sadness and struggle in the face of great challenges. Science and Technology All people use technology to shape and control their environments, and they use science to try and understand it. Technology refers to the use of knowledge, tools, and skills to solve problems. Science is a way of understanding the world through observation and the testing of ideas. Factors Shaping Technology Use Historically, the type of technology a culture developed has been strongly tied to environ mental factors. Not only were tools and technology made from local resources , they were also designed to solve specific problems posed by nature. For exa mple, farmers might build dams to prevent rivers from flooding and destroying their crops. Other factors such as belief systems, political decisions, and economic factors can influence technology use, too. Some religious groups, like the Amish people of the United States, selectively use technology. They read - ily use gas and horse-drawn buggies. However, they reject technology th ey think will undermine their traditions, including cars and computers . Government decisions also affect technology use. North Korea, for example, restricts Internet use. To use the Internet, a North Korean must have special permission and may use it for government purposes only. Worldwide, however, the primary barrier between people and technolog y is economic. New technologies are simply too expensive for many of the world’s people to access them. Impact of Technology Throughout time, advances in science and technol - ogy have made life easier. Some discoveries even changed the world. Consider, for example, the work of French scientist Louis Pasteur. His work revolutionized health and medicine. In 1870 Pasteur discovered t hat germs caused infections. To prevent the spread of disease, he urged people to wash their hands. He also developed vaccines to prevent deadly diseases and a process for removing bacteria from food. Today, most milk, cheese, and juice on our grocery shelves have been sterilized, or made germ-free, through pasteurization. Inventors, too, change the world. For example, in 1879, Thomas Edison developed an affordable and practical light bulb. At the time, the invention caused a sensation. People no longer had to burn candles and oil lamps for light at night. Over time, electricity transformed daily life and work for many of the world’s people. Nature’s awesome power is a universal theme in the painting of a great wave created by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.Reading Check Describe What are the main types of cultural expressions?

Answers will vary, but students should accurately describe the impact of a discovery, an innovation, a scientist, and an inventor. In fact, Thomas Edison had a friend in the auto industry who would greatly benefit from the new technology. In 1913 automaker Henry Ford launched the world’s first moving assembly line. This new process allowed workers to decrease construction time on a single vehicle from 12 hours to roughly 90 minutes. The introduction of computers into the workplace has demanded new skill sets from employees. Consider the work of an auto mechanic from 50 years ago and today. Every car manufactured today contains at least one computer system. Auto mechanics must understand these systems in order to effectively work on a vehicle. All of these technologies greatly increased the rate of production. Peopl e were able to work faster and more efficiently, which resulted in a larger supply of available goods. Today, scientists and inventors continue to identify and solve problems . They often work in groups to make discoveries or invent new devices or products that will benefit future generations. This involves careful thi nk- ing about the future and making predictions about the social, political, economic, cultural, and environmental impact of their work.

Students’ answers should show an understanding of the topics covered in Lesson 1. 105a Module 3, Lesson 1 continued from page 97 More About . . . Arab Culture There were two attempts to unite Arab countries in the 20th century. The first resulted in the United Arab Republic (1958–1961), and the second in the Federation of Arab Republics (1972–1977). The purpose of these attempts was to unite people who shared the Arab culture into a single country or union of countries. The nations were unable to agree on many things, however, and they remain separate today. Anwar al-Sadat (1918–1981) Anwar al-Sadat was elected president of Egypt in 1970. After involvement in several wars in the region, Sadat worked toward peace between the Arab nation of Egypt and the Jewish nation of Israel. He and Israeli leader Menachem Begin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 for leading peace negotiations. Sadat was assassinated by extremists in his own military in 1981. 10. Evaluate How does foreign trade affect the cultures of regions? Give one example. Foreign trade introduces ideas, goods, and practices into new regions. Trade creates cultural diffusion by spreading ideas from one culture to another, and cultures can be changed as a result. For example, the seafaring Phoenicians spread their culture throughout the Mediterranean and influenced other people who adopted their written language, ways of manufacturing goods, and advances in navigation. 11.

People form governments to ensure an orderly society and to settle disputes that arise among people. To keep order, people have created laws for people to obey and have named leaders to make and carry out those laws. Laws help settle disputes by protecting people and their property by setting standards that people are expected to obey. 13. Make Judgments How do artistic performances that address warfare, politics, and social inequalities often affect their audiences? The intent of performances using creative expressions is to inspire others. Therefore, performances that address issues of politics, warfare, and social inequalities often create strong emotions and may cause people to act to address these issues. 14. Compare and Contrast How are science and technology related? Give one example. Science is the pursuit of understanding the world through observation and the testing of theories, while technology is the use of inventions, knowledge, and skills to solve problems. Louis Pasteur used science to understand that germs cause disease, and this encouraged the development of vaccines to prevent diseases from infecting people and the process of pasteurization that removes bacteria from foodcontinued from page 99 More About . . . Connect to Today: Corporate Culture Many students and job seekers assume that one company is just like another. Yet corporate culture—a company’s unique set of values, rules, and way of doing business—varies greatly. Corporate culture can affect how many hours employees are expected to work, whether work relationships are formal or casual, and even how employees are expected to dress. When considering careers, experts often advise people to consider how well they will “fit in” with a company’s culture—which can be just as important a factor to consider as salary, benefits, and career growth.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS The Human World 105b LESSON 2Population Density Big Idea Population studies are an important part of geography.Lesson 2 Planner Population Graph: Forecast for World Population Graph: Irish Migration to the United States, 1845–1855 Graph: World Population Growth, 1500–2000 Document-Based Investigation: World Population Density Key Terms Review Reading Check Graphic Organizer Activity Lesson AssessmentPopulation Explosion 7.5 Billion and GrowingVisualsMaps, Graphs, and ChartsVideos Extend and EnrichSources Assessment 105c Module 3, Lesson 2 Population Explosion Graph Students create a graph to record world population growth rates per minute, per day, and per week.Online Lesson 2 Enrichment Activities 7.5 Billion and Growing Article Students speculate on the ways population and environmental change will impact the world by the year 2050 and write a futuristic newscast based on their visions.

Review the scenario with students, and lead a class discussion around responses to the question. You may wish to review the following points to frame your discussion. Consider reasons you LIKE living in a city: •There is always something to do. •There are several interesting neighborhoods. •There are a variety of cultures. Consider reasons you DISLIKE living in a city: •The traffic is heavy. •The crime rate is high. •There is a lot of pollution. 2. Direct Teach Introduce the Big Idea: Population studies are an important part of geography. Ask students if they know what the United States population is. ( about 320 million ) Then ask students to guess the population of the United States in 1960. ( about 180 million ) Have students name some ways the country is different now than in 1960 simply because of the change in population. 3. Practice/Assess/Inquire Divide the room into at least three “countries. ” Assign students randomly to each, creating unequal groups. Ask each group to name its “country, ” count its citizens for this year, and determine its density according to a random number of square miles you provide. Then tell students it is ten years later, and direct some students to “migrate” to different countries. Give students a reason for their migration, such as famine, flood, war, and so on. Ask each group to recalculate its density after the migration is done. 4. Explore (Collaborative Exploration) Have each group post its density on the board for each year. Ask students how life in their country might have changed as the population changed. 5. Whole Group Close/Reflect Ask students to create a chart or bar graph that shows the population density for each country for each year. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 7: Charts ONLINE DOCUMENT-BASED INVESTIGATION The Human World World Population Density is the second of four document-based investigations that students will analyze in The Human World.

Lesson 2 Population The Big Idea Population studies are an impor- tant part of geography. Main Ideas ■The study of population pat- terns helps geographers learn about the world. ■Population statistics and trends are important measures of population change. Key Terms and Places population population density birthrate migrationmigrationIf YOU lived there . . . You live in Mexico City, one of the largest and most crowded cities in the world. You realize just how crowded it is whenever you ride the subway at rush hour! You love the excitement of living in a big city. There is always something interesting to do. At the same time, the city has a lot of crime. Heavy traffic pollutes the air. What do you like and dislike about living in a large city? Population Patterns How many people live in your community? Do you live in a small town, a huge city, or somewhere in between? Your com- munity’s population, or the total number of people in a given area, determines a great deal about the place in which you live. Population influences the variety of businesses, the types of transportation, and the number of schools in your community. Because population has a huge impact on our lives, it is an important part of geography. Geographers who study human populations are particularly interested in patterns that emerge over time. They study such information as how many people live in an area, why people live where they do, and how popula- tions change. Population patterns like these can tell us much about our world. Population Density Some places on Earth are crowded with people. Others are almost empty. One statistic geographers use to examine populations is population density, a measure of the number of people living in an area. Population density is expressed as persons per square mile or square kilometer. Population density provides us with important information about a place. The more people per square mile in a region, the more crowded, or dense, it is. Japan, for example, has a popula- tion density of about 897 people per square mile (around 347 per square km). That is a high population density. In many parts of Japan, people are crowded together in large cities and space is very limited. In contrast, Australia has a very low 106 Module 3 106 Module 3, Lesson 2 Teach the Main Idea The study of population patterns helps geographers learn about the world. Recall How is population density usually expressed? as persons per square mile or square kilometer Contrast How does the population density and the space available differ in Japan and Australia? Japan has a high population density and little space available; Australia has a low population density and has much open space . Make Inferences Why do you think land is often more expensive in areas with high population densities? because less land is available More About . . . Population Clocks The U.S. Census Bureau and other groups try to estimate how many people are living in the world at any time. They have constructed “population clocks” that use information about population trends to estimate world population every few minutes. The Census Bureau clock can be viewed at http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popclockworld. html. The formulas groups use to estimate population differ. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the world population at 6 billion people on June 1, 1999, while the United Nations celebrated the “Day of Six Billion” on October 12, 1999. ONLINE DOCUMENT-BASED INVESTIGATION World Population Density Have students explore the map using the interactive features and answer the associated questions. Analyze Sources Study the map. What patterns can you identify? Possible answer: Many areas with the highest population densities are along coastlines. Lowest population densities are found in areas that have challenging environments. In print edition, see map of same title. Place Which continent is the most densely populated? Which is the least densely populated? Europe; Antarctica Region Why might the population density of far Northern America be so low? Much of the northern part of the continent has a cold climate and harsh environment. STRUGGLING READERS Population Density 1. To illustrate and to help students understand population density, draw several equal-sized squares on the board and label each “1 square mile. ” Give each square a name (possibly from local area towns and cities). Ask students to do the same on their own paper. 2. On the board, “populate” each square with dots representing people. Ask students to do the same on their own papers, using different numbers of dots in each square. Assign a population number to each dot; for example, 1 dot could represent 10, 100, or 1,000 people.3. Define population density as the number of people per square mile. Ask students to display their drawings and list or tell the population density in each square. 4. Discuss how life might be different for people living in dense and less-dense squares, including available land for housing, farming, industrial sites, travel, and so on. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 11: Discussions For additional instruction, go to end of lesson.

Only around 8 people per square mile (about 3 per square km) live there. Australia has many wide-open spaces with very few people. How do you think population density affects life in a particular place? In places with high population densities, the land is often expensive, roads are crowded, and buildings tend to be taller. On the other hand, places with low population densities tend to have more open spaces, less traffic, and more available land. Population density also affects the economic development of a region. These effects can be positive or negative depending on the circumstances. Areas with higher population densities and abundant resources have the potential to create more job opportunities, which can add value to the region. In contrast, a larger population density in regions with limited resources can present many challenges. It may be difficult to provide goods and services to every person when resources are in short supply.

You may wish to use the associated question as a discussion prompt. Analyze Visuals What does the photo of Tokyo tell you about its high population density? Possible answer: They build tall structures to accommodate a lack of space. yellow areas indicate sparse populations. When an area is thinly popu- lated, it is often because the land does not provide a very good life. These areas may have rugged mountains or harsh deserts where people cannot grow crops. Some areas may be frozen all year long, making survival there very difficult. For these reasons, very few people live in parts of far North America, Greenland, northern Asia, and Australia. Notice on the world population density map that some areas have large clusters of population. Such clusters can be found in East and South Asia, Europe, and eastern North America. Fertile soil, plentiful vegetation , reli- able sources of water and minerals, and a good agricultural climate make these regions favorable for settlement. For example, the North China Plain in East Asia is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. The area’s plentiful agricultural land, many rivers, and mild climate hav e made it an ideal place to settle. The natural resources in these regions offer job opportunities in farming, mining, and timber production. These indus- tries can provide great economic benefits to the area. As populations swell in desirable areas, there is a higher demand for resources. These demands can drastically affect the environment. Man y developed nations consume resources faster than they can regenerate them. In some areas, population has been growing faster than food sup- plies. The amount of available farmland is shrinking as regions make room for more people. Coastal ecosystems are being pressured by urban develop- ment. The demand for fresh water also increases with population. Some countries may even face shortages in the future.Many parts of Japan have a high population density. Space is extremely limited in the city of Tokyo. Australia has a very low population density. There is plenty of space for people living along the Noosa River.

Connect to Today: Migration People have been migrating from one area to another since before civilization began. Since the 1600s North America and the United States have been a destination for many people. In the 1800s and early 1900s immigrants poured in from Europe. Today, migration to the United States continues, with about 9 million people arriving between 1995 and 2003. About one-third of those people came from Mexico. Another third came from other countries in the Americas. Immigrants from Asia make up more than one-fourth of the total, while Europeans account for only about one in seven new immigrants. For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. Population Change The study of population is much more important than you might realize. The number of people living in an area affects all elements of life—the availability of housing and jobs, whether hospitals and schools open or close, even the amount of available food. Geographers track changes in populations by examining important statistics, studying the movement o f people, and analyzing population trends. Tracking Population Changes Geographers examine three key statis- tics to learn about population changes. These statistics are important for studying a country’s population over time. Three key statistics—birthrate, death rate, and the rate of natural increase—track changes in population. Births add to a population. Deaths subtract from it. The annual number of births per 1,000 people is called the birthrate. Similarly, the death rate is the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people. The birthrate minus the death rate equals the percentage of natural increase, or the rate at which a population is changing. For exam- ple, Denmark has a rate of natural increase of 0.01 percent. This means it has slightly more births than deaths and a very slight population increase. Population growth rates differ from one place to another. In some coun- tries, populations are growing very slowly or even shrinking. Many coun- tries in Europe and North America have very low rates of natural increase. In Russia, for example, the birthrate is about 11 and the death rate is around 14. The result is a negative rate of natural increase and a shrinking population. In most countries around the world, however, populations are grow- ing. Mali, for example, has a rate of natural increase of about 3.1 percent. While that may sound small, it means that Mali’s population is expected to double in the next 20 years! High population growth rates can pose Calculate Population Density Population density measures the number of people living in an area. To calculate population density, divide a place’s total population by its area in square miles (or square kilometers). For example, if your city has a population of 100,000 people and an area of 100 square miles, you would divide 100,000 by 100. This would give you a population density of 1,000 people per square mile (100,000 ÷ 100 = 1,000).Connect to Math City PopulationTotal Area (square miles)Population Density (people per square mile) Adelaide, Australia1,255,516 705 1,781 Lima, Peru 9,897,033 1,032 9,590 Nairobi, Kenya 3,914,791 269 14,553 Source: World Urbanization Prospects , Population Division, UN Dept. of Economic and Social Affairs Evaluate If a city had a population of 615,000 and a total land area of 250 square miles, what would its population density be?

Analyze Graphs In what year did Irish migration to the United States peak? some challenges, as governments try to provide enough jobs, education, and medical care for their rapidly grow- ing populations. Many governments track their regional population patterns and trends. Analyzing current data and mak- ing population projections can help leaders address present and future needs of citizens. This might involve enacting new laws that protect the natural resources of an area. A government could also develop policies that provide more economic opportunities for a region. For example, China’s most recent Five-Year Plan promotes the use of cleaner energy sources to reduce pollution. The plan also outlines ways that China will strengthen support for farmers, increase agricultural income, and improve rural infrastructure. Migration A common cause of population change is migration. Migration is the process of moving from one place to live in another. As one country loses citizens as a result of migration, its population can decline. At the same time, another country may gain population as people settle there. People migrate for many reasons. Some factors push people to leave their country, while other factors pull, or attract, people to new countries. Warfare, a lack of jobs, Module 3110 110 Module 3, Lesson 2 ADVANCED/GIFTED World Population 1.

For example, during the Irish potato famine of the mid-1800s, poverty and disease forced some 1.5 million people to leave Ireland. Opportunities for a better life often pull people to new countries. For example, in the 1800s and early 1900s, thousands of British citizens migrated to Australia in search of cheap lan d. Political conditions such as freedom or persecution can also cause move- ment. The political system of apartheid in South Africa imposed a regime of segregation and racial oppression from the mid-1900s until 1994. Thousands of black South Africans were forced to migrate to other parts of Africa. Environmental factors such as climate can also lead to migra- tion. For example, people who live in harsh climates are often attracted to regions with milder climates. World Population Trends In the last 200 years, Earth’s population has exploded. For thousands of years, world population growth was low and relatively steady. About 2,000 years ago, the world had some 300 million people. By 1800 there were almost 1 billion people. Since 1800, better health care and improved food production have supported tremendous population growth. By 2012 the world’s population passed 7 billion people. Advances in food production and health care have dramatically lowered death rates. As a result, the global population has seen incredible growth over the last 200 years.

Population trends are an important part of the study of the world’s people. Two important population trends are clear today. The first trend indicates that the population growth in some of the more industrialized nations has begun to slow. For example, Germany and France have low rates of natural increase. A second trend indicates that less industrial - ized countries, like Nigeria and Bangladesh, often have high growth rates. These trends affect a country’s work force and government aid.

How does high population density often affect life in a country’s cities? There is little traffic. Buildings tend to be short. Land is usually expensive. There is abundant land available. Alternate Question Which of the following is an accurate statement about population density? Select the three correct answers. Cities with high population densities tend to have less traffic. Cities with high population densities tend to have tall buildings. Cities with low population densities tend to have crowded roads. Countries with high population densities tend to have expensive land. Countries with low population densities tend to have more open spaces. Countries with low population densities tend to have little available land. 2. Why do geographers study population trends? to understand the movement of people to distribute available food to people to decide whether to open or close hospitals to determine whether housing or jobs will be available Alternate Question Select the answer choice from the drop-down list to complete the sentence correctly. Geographers study population changes resulting from a number of factors, such as the movement of people.3. How are low population densities and geography related? When an area has a low population density, it is often because the land cannot support life. Areas like deserts, mountains, or the Arctic do not have high population densities because the geography is too harsh to support human settlement. It is difficult to grow crops in deserts, along mountainsides, or in icy areas, so people choose not to live there. 4. Why might Mali’s population growth cause problems in the future? A natural increase rate of 3.1 percent will cause Mali’s population to double in the next 20 years. This population growth, if unchecked, will most likely overwhelm Mali’s ability to provide for its aging population. Mali’s government will probably struggle to provide its citizens with enough jobs, good education, and adequate medical care.
