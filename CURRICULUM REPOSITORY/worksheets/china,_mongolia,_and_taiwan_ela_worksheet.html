Main Ideas •Mongolia is a sparsely populated country where many people live as nomads. •Taiwan is a small island with a dense population and a highly industrialized economy. History China’s capital city, Beijing, is over 3,000 years old and home to more than 23 million people. Culture Chinese opera uses music and symbolism to tell stories. The actors wear bold and colorful makeup that has special meanings.Geography Horses play an important role in Mongolian life and culture. Many Mongolians are nomads and use horses to travel across the country’s large plains. 927 China, Mongolia, and Taiwan China, Mongolia, and Taiwan 927 Reading Social Studies READING FOCUS Understand Implied Main Ideas Group students into pairs. Have each student think of an activity they want to convince everyone to do, such as buy pizza from a certain place or see a certain movie. Have students write down three reasons their idea is a good one. Next, have partners exchange papers and see if they can guess each other’s idea based only on their reasons for doing it. Y ou Try It! Read the following sentences. Then use the steps listed to the right to develop a statement that expresses the main idea of the paragraph. Exchange your statement with a partner to check your understanding of the implied main idea. topic: farming in China; facts and details: 300 million people work in farming, China leading producer of rice, wheat, corn, and potatoes, only 11 percent of land is good for farming, most farms in eastern plains and river valleys, one-third of workers are farmers, terraces maximize land use; details repeated: many people work in farming; main idea: farming in China requires human work and adapts to the available land Reading Social Studies About 300 million Chinese work in farming. The country is a leading producer of rice, wheat, corn, and potatoes. Only about 11 percent of China’s land is good for farming. Most farms are in China’s eastern plains and river valleys. So how does China produce so much food? More than a third of Chi- nese workers are farmers. In addition, farmers cut terraces into hillsides to make the most use of the land.YOU TRY IT! Read the following sentences. Then use the steps listed to the right to develop a statement that expresses the main idea of the paragraph. Exchange your statement with a partner to check your understanding of the implied main idea. As you read this module, use the steps in this lesson to help you identify implied main ideas.Understand Implied Main Ideas READING FOCUS Main ideas are often stated in a paragraph’s topic sentence. When the main idea is not stated directly, you can find it by looking at the details in the paragraph. First, rea d the text carefully and think about the topic. Next, look at the facts and details and ask yourself what details are repeated. What points do those details make? Then create a statement that sums up the main idea. Examine how this process works fo r the paragraph below. In 1644 an ethnic group called the Manchu from northeastern Asia took control of China and founded the Qing (CHING) dynasty. Qing rule was peaceful until the 1800s. At that time, European powers began spreading their empires into Asia. Much of China fell under European influence. At the same time, many Chinese wanted to end dynastic rule. This unhappiness sparked a revolution.What is the topic? China’s contact with Europe What details are repeated? China was under dynastic rule. What is the main idea? European influence and unhappiness with dynastic rule led the Chinese to revolution.What are the facts and details? • Qing rule was peaceful until the 1800s. • European empires spread into Asia. • Much of China fell under European control. • Many Chinese wanted an end to dynastic rule. 928 Module 29 928 Module 29 LESSON 1Flooding in China Game: Where Am I?

Whole Class Open/Introduction If YOU lived there . . . What do you expect to see on your travels? Review the scenario with students and lead a class discussion around responses to the question. You may wish to review the following points to frame your discussion. Consider the NATURAL features: •very mountainous regions •outskirts of desert regions •fertile river valleys of the North China Plain Consider the HUMAN features: •heavily populated areas •many farms; some of China’s oldest cities •some of the Great Wall of China 2. Direct Teach Introduce the Big Idea: Physical features, climate, and resources vary across China, Mongolia, and Taiwan. Point out to students that China, Mongolia, and Taiwan make up a large part of East Asia. Ask students to speculate on the physical features and climates that are found in this region. As you record their comments on the board, tell students that this lesson will show them which of their ideas are accurate. 3. Practice/Assess/Inquire Have students create a chart with three columns. Have them label the columns China, Mongolia , and Taiwan . As they read the section, have them list details about each country’s physical geography. 4. Explore Have each student create five True/False questions about the information. Then have them take turns quizzing each other. When students identify false items, have them explain why they are false. 5. Whole Group Close/Reflect Have students write three paragraphs in which they explain the effect that physical geography has on human life in these countries. In their paragraphs, have students include at least one dictionary definition and three words they found in a thesaurus. Have them underline these items. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 7: Charts; and 37: Writing Assignments ONLINE DOCUMENT-BASED INVESTIGATION China, Mongolia, and Taiwan The map China, Mongolia, and Taiwan: Physical is the first of three document-based investigations that students will analyze in this module. Students will use the map’s interactive features to explore the region.Teach the Main Idea Physical features of China, Mongolia, and Taiwan include mountains, plateaus and basins, plains, and rivers. Describe Where are the Himalayas and the Plateau of Tibet located? in southwest China Identify What are two major deserts in the region? the Taklimakan in western China and the Gobi in Mongolia Draw Conclusions How might the fact that Mongolia is a landlocked country affect its culture? Possible answers: fewer opportunities for trade and cultural exchange; traditional ways might flourishMore About . . . Climbing Mount Everest American Erik Weihenmayer reached the summit of the Himalayas’ Mount Everest in 2001. Many people have climbed Mount Everest. However, Weihenmayer is blind. He has also climbed Mount McKinley and Kilimanjaro. Mongolia’s Geography Mongolia is best known for its mountains, rolling plains, and deserts. But, it is also home to some surprising geographic features. The country has over 3,000 lakes, many of which are salty. More than 200 extinct volcanoes are located in the eastern part of the country. Lesson 1 Physical Geography The Big Idea Physical features, climate, and resources vary across China, Mongolia, and Taiwan. Main Ideas ■Physical features of China, Mongolia, and Taiwan include mountains, plateaus and basins, plains, and rivers. ■China, Mongolia, and Taiwan have a range of climates and natural resources. Key Terms and Places Himalayas Plateau of Tibet Gobi North China Plain Huang He loess Chang JiangChang JiangIf YOU lived there . . . You are a young filmmaker who lives in Guangzhou, a port city in southern China. You are preparing to make a documentary film about the Huang He, one of China’s great rivers. To make your film, you will follow the river across northern China. Your journey will take you from the Himalayas to the coast of the Yellow Sea. What do you expect to see on your travels? Physical Features Have you seen the view from the top of the world? At 29,029 feet (8,848 m), Mount Everest in the Himalayas is the world’s highest mountain. From atop Everest, look east. Through misty clouds, icy peaks stretch out before you, fading to land far below. This is China. About the size of the United States, China has a range of physical features. They include not only the world’s tallest peaks but also some of its driest deserts and longest rivers. Two other areas are closely linked to China. To the north lies Mongolia (mahn-GOHL-yuh). This landlocked coun try is dry and rugged, with vast grasslands and desert. In con- trast, Taiwan (TY-WAHN), off the coast of mainland China, is a green tropical island. Look at the map to see the whole region’s landforms. Mountains Much of this large region, including Taiwan, is mountainous. In southwest China, the Himalayas run along the border. They are Earth’s tallest mountain range. Use the physical map of China, Mongolia, and Taiwan in this lesson to locate the region’s other ranges. As a tip, the Chinese word shan means “mountain.” Other Landforms Many of the mountain ranges are sepa- rated by plateaus, basins, and deserts. In southwest China, the Plateau of Tibet lies north of the Himalayas. The world’s highest plateau, it is called the Roof of the World.

ONLINE GRAPHIC ORGANIZER Physical Geography As students read the lesson, have them use the graphic organizer to take notes. Students can review their graphic organizer notes at the end of the lesson to answer the following question: Summarize What are the major physical features of China, Mongolia, and Taiwan? Possible answers: mountains—Himalayas, karst towers; plateaus, basins, deserts—Plateau of Tibet, Taklimakan Desert, Gobi Desert, Turpan Depression; plains and river valleys—China Plain; rivers—Huang He, Chang Jiang ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS Identifying Physical Features 1. To help students gain a greater understanding of the physical features in China, Mongolia, and Taiwan, organize them into pairs. 2. Review the superlative form of short adjectives (e.g., quick, quickest ). Adding -est to an adjective means the noun it is describing is the maximum or most extreme.3. Ask students to work with their partners to identify and locate on the map the world’s tallest mountain range, highest plateau, and coldest desert. Ask them to do the same for China’s lowest point and Asia’s longest river. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubrics 1: Acquiring Information; and 21: Map Reading For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. ONLINE DOCUMENT-BASED INVESTIGATION China, Mongolia, and Taiwan: Physical Have students explore the map using the interactive features and answer the associated question. Analyze Sources How might rivers influence patterns of settlement and trade in this region? Possible answer: Rivers provide a source of water for farming and drinking. They may also be used as a transportation route. As a result many people likely live and trade near rivers in this region. In print edition, see map of same title. 1.

Moving north, we find a low, dry area. A large part of this area is the Taklimakan (tah-kluh-muh-KAHN) Desert, a barren land of sand dunes and blinding sandstorms. In fact, sandstorms are so common that the desert’s Turkish name, Taklimakan, has come to mean “Enter and you will not come out.” To the northeast, the Turpan (toohr-PAHN) Depression is China’s lowest point, at 505 feet (154 m) below sea level. Continuing northeast, in Mongolia we find the Gobi. This harsh area of gravel and rock is the world’s coldest desert. Temperatures can drop to below –40°F (–40°C).Map questions 1.

Describe Where do most typhoons occur in the region? in the southeast Compare and Contrast Which resource do China and Taiwan have that is not plentiful in Mongolia? farmland More About . . . Fossil Hunting from Space Buried under the deep sands of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, researchers discovered a rich fossil site in 1993. For years, they have gone back to the Gobi in search of more fossils. However, these trips were very expensive and dangerous. Today, these scientists are using satellites to find new fossil sites. The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses satellites to determine exact locations—a much more efficient process than walking in one of the world’s biggest deserts. READING CHECK Summarize What are the main physical features found in this region? mountains, plateaus, deserts, plains, rivers, and basins ADVANCED/GIFTED News Brief: Flooding in China 1. Have students review the information about flooding in China that occurred at Lake Dongting Hu. Have students research floods at this lake, as well as other recent floods in China. 2. Have students work individually or with a partner to select one severe flood and prepare an oral news report on it. Students should include maps, statistics, the consequences of the flood, and before-and-after pictures.3. Have students present their news reports to the class. Encourage other students to listen actively, take notes, and ask relevant questions about the event and its aftermath. *Alternative Assessment Handbook, Rubric 24: Oral Presentations For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. ONLINE INTERACTIVE VISUALS Image Compare: Flooding in China Have students explore and compare the images using the interactive slider. You may wish to use the associated question as a discussion prompt. Analyze Visuals Why might people continue to live in areas that often flood? Possible answer: because the soil is fertile for growing crops In the print edition, see feature titled Flooding in China. Reading Check Summarize What are the main physical features found in this region?In east China, the land levels out into low plains and river valleys. These fertile plains, such as the North China Plain, are China’s main population centers and farmlands. On Taiwan, a plain on the west coast is the island’s main population center. Rivers In China, two great rivers run west to east. The Huang He (HUANG HEE), or the Yellow River, flows across northern China. Along its course, this river picks up large amounts of loess (LES), or fertile, yellow- ish soil. The soil colors the river and gives it its name. In summer, the Huang He often floods. The floods spread layers of loess, enriching the soil for farming. However, such floods have killed millions of people. For this reason, the river is called China’s Sorrow. The mighty Chang (CHAHNG) Jiang, or the Yangzi (YAHNG-zee) River, flows across central China. It is Asia’s longest river and a major transporta- tion route. Climate and Resources Climate varies widely across the region. The tropical southeast is warm to hot, and monsoons bring heavy rains in summer. In addition, typhoons can strike the southeast coast in summer and fall. Similar to hurricanes, these violent storms bring high winds and rain. As we move to the north- east, the climate is drier and colder. Winter temperatures can drop below 0°F (–18°C). For comparison, these arrows are pointing to the same place in each image.Before AfterChina’s rivers and lakes often flood during the summer rainy season. The satellite images here show Lake Dongting Hu in southern China. The lake appears blue, and the land appears red. Soon after the Before image was taken, heavy rains led to flooding. The After image shows the results. Compare the two images to see the extent of the flood, which killed more than 3,000 people and destroyed some 5 million homes.

Huang He (Yellow River) and Chang Jiang (Yangzi River) b. Explain How does the Huang He both benefit and hurt China’s people? It benefits China by enriching the soil for farming. It hurts China by flooding. c. Elaborate Why do you think many people in China live on the North China Plain? Possible answer: More food can be grown in this area to support a larger population. 2. a. Define What is a typhoon? similar to a hurricane, a violent storm that brings heavy wind and rain b. Contrast What are some differences between the climates of southeast and northwest China? in the southeast—warm to hot, with heavy rains brought by monsoons; in the northwest—mainly dry, with temperatures ranging from cold to hotc. Rate Based on the different climates in this region, which part of the region would you prefer to live in? Why? Answers will vary, but students should support their opinions with information from the section. Critical Thinking 3. Categorize Use a chart to organize, identify, and describe the main physical features of China, Mongolia, and Taiwan. Mountains—Himalayas; Plateaus, basins, deserts—Plateau of Tibet, Taklimakan Desert, Gobi Desert, Turpan Depression; Plains and river valleys—North China Plain; Rivers— Huang He, Chang Jiang For additional instruction, go to end of lesson. GAME Where Am I? China, Mongolia, and Taiwan Have students play the game to test their knowledge of the geography of China, Mongolia, and Taiwan. Reading Check Contrast Which of these three countries has the most natural resources?In the north and west, the climate is mainly dry. Temperatures vary across the area and can get both very hot and cold. China has a wealth of natural resources. Like its climate, China’s natu- ral resources show tremendous variety. The country is rich in mineral resources and is a leading producer of coal, lead, tin, and tungsten. China produces many other minerals and metals as well. China’s forestland and farmland are also valuable resources. Mongolia’s natural resources include minerals such as coal, iron, and t in as well as livestock. Taiwan’s major natural resource is its farmland. Impo r- tant crops include sugarcane, tea, and bananas.
