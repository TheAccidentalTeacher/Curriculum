## Conclusion

This calendar-aligned framework ensures the world geography curriculum app design fits precisely with the Copper River School District's 2025-2026 academic calendar. By distributing the 32 curriculum units across the four official quarters and aligning simulations with available instructional time, the app can provide a seamless learning experience that respects the school's established schedule while maintaining the integrity of the curriculum.

The quarterly simulations are strategically placed to serve as culminating experiences before the end of each quarter, allowing for meaningful assessment and application of geographic knowledge and skills. The inclusion of 7 flex days per quarter provides necessary flexibility to accommodate unexpected schedule changes, extended learning opportunities, or additional review as needed.
